But the Connorly Report is commissioned by Danto Foods, Ocksenfrey's largest corporate rival, and early drafts of the report are submitted for approval to Danto Foods' public relations department.

"Proponents of the electric car maintain that when the technical problems associated with its battery design are solved, such cars will be widely used and, because they are emission-free, will result in an abatement of the environmental degradation caused by auto emissions. But unless we dam more rivers, the electricity to charge these batteries will come from nuclear or coal-fired power plants.

"It is now a common complaint that the electronic media have corroded the intellectual skills required and fostered by the literary media. But several centuries ago the complaint was that certain intellectual skills, such as the powerful memory and extemporaneous eloquence that were intrinsic to oral culture, were being destroyed by the spread of literacy. So, what awaits us is probably a mere alteration of the human mind rather than its devolution.",Yes,https://www.lsac.org/lsat/lsat-prep/practice-test/section-2,,Test Prep

This goal will be accomplished by the annual vaccination of high-risk individuals: everyone 65 and older as well as anyone with a chronic disease that might cause them to experience complications from the influenza virus.

"Modern science is built on the process of posing hypotheses and testing them against observations—in essence, attempting to show that the hypotheses are incorrect. Nothing brings more recognition than overthrowing conventional wisdom. It is accordingly unsurprising that some scientists are skeptical of the widely accepted predictions of global warming.

"Historian: The Land Party achieved its only national victory in Banestria in 1935. It received most of its support that year in rural and semirural areas, where the bulk of Banestria's population lived at the time. The economic woes of the years surrounding that election hit agricultural and small business interests the hardest, and the Land Party specifically targeted those groups in 1935. I conclude that the success of the Land Party that year was due to the combination of the Land Party's specifically addressing the concerns of these groups and the depth of the economic problems people in these groups were facing.",Yes,https://www.lsac.org/lsat/lsat-prep/practice-test/section-2,,Test Prep

"Car companies solicit consumer information on such human factors as whether a seat is comfortable or whether a set of controls is easy to use.

"Carolyn: The artist Marc Quinn has displayed, behind a glass plate, biologically replicated fragments of Sir John Sulston's DNA, calling it a ""conceptual portrait"" of Sulston. But to be a portrait, something must bear a recognizable resemblance to its subject. Arnold: I disagree.

"Antonio: One can live a life of moderation by never deviating from the middle course. But then one loses the joy of spontaneity and misses the opportunities that come to those who are occasionally willing to take great chances, or to go too far.

So Fabric-Soft is the most effective fabric softener available.",Yes,https://www.lsac.org/lsat/lsat-prep/practice-test/section-3,,Test Prep
"Naturalist: The recent claims that the Tasmanian tiger is not extinct are false. The Tasmanian tiger's natural habitat was taken over by sheep farming decades ago, resulting in the animal's systematic elimination from the area. Since then naturalists working in the region have discovered no hard evidence of its survival, such as carcasses or tracks.

"Therapist: Cognitive psychotherapy focuses on changing a patient's conscious beliefs. Thus, cognitive psychotherapy is likely to be more effective at helping patients overcome psychological problems than are forms of psychotherapy that focus on changing unconscious beliefs and desires, since only conscious beliefs are under the patient's direct conscious control.",Yes,https://www.lsac.org/lsat/lsat-prep/practice-test/section-3,,Test Prep
"Commentator: In academic scholarship, sources are always cited, and methodology and theoretical assumptions are set out, so as to allow critical study, replication, and expansion of scholarship. In open-source software, the code in which the program is written can be viewed and modified by individual users for their purposes without getting permission from the producer or paying a fee. In contrast, the code of proprietary software is kept secret, and modifications can be made only by the producer, for a fee. This shows that open-source software better matches the values embodied in academic scholarship, and since scholarship is central to the mission of universities, universities should use only open-source software.",Yes,https://www.lsac.org/lsat/lsat-prep/practice-test/section-3,,Test Prep

"Editor: Many candidates say that if elected they will reduce governmental intrusion into voters' lives. But voters actually elect politicians who instead promise that the government will provide assistance to solve their most pressing problems. Governmental assistance, however, costs money, and money can come only from taxes, which can be considered a form of governmental intrusion.

"1. Several years have now elapsed since I first became aware that I had accepted, even from my youth, many false opinions for true, and that consequently what I afterward based on such principles was highly doubtful; and from that time I was convinced of the necessity of undertaking once in my life to rid myself of all the opinions I had adopted, and of commencing anew the work of building from the foundation, if I desired to establish a firm and abiding superstructure in the sciences. But as this enterprise appeared to me to be one of great magnitude, I waited until I had attained an age so mature as to leave me no hope that at any stage of life more advanced I should be better able to execute my design. On this account, I have delayed so long that I should henceforth consider I was doing wrong were I still to consume in deliberation any of the time that now remains for action. To-day, then, since I have opportunely freed my mind from all cares and am happily disturbed by no passions, and since I am in the secure possession of leisure in a peaceable retirement, I will at length apply myself earnestly and freely to the general overthrow of all my former opinions",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/i.php,Descartes,Meditation One
"2. But, to this end, it will not be necessary for me to show that the whole of these are false—a point, perhaps, which I shall never reach; but as even now my reason convinces me that I ought not the less carefully to withhold belief from what is not entirely certain and indubitable, than from what is manifestly false, it will be sufficient to justify the rejection of the whole if I shall find in each some ground for doubt. Nor for this purpose will it be necessary even to deal with each belief individually, which would be truly an endless labor; but, as the removal from below of the foundation necessarily involves the downfall of the whole edifice, I will at once approach the criticism of the principles on which all my former beliefs rested.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/i.php,Descartes,Meditation One
"3. All that I have, up to this moment, accepted as possessed of the highest truth and certainty, I received either from or through the senses. I observed, however, that these sometimes misled us; and it is the part of prudence not to place absolute confidence in that by which we have even once been deceived.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/i.php,Descartes,Meditation One
"4. But it may be said, perhaps, that, although the senses occasionally mislead us respecting minute objects, and such as are so far removed from us as to be beyond the reach of close observation, there are yet many other of their informations (presentations), of the truth of which it is manifestly impossible to doubt; as for example, that I am in this place, seated by the fire, clothed in a winter dressing gown, that I hold in my hands this piece of paper, with other intimations of the same nature. But how could I deny that I possess these hands and this body, and withal escape being classed with persons in a state of insanity, whose brains are so disordered and clouded by dark bilious vapors as to cause them pertinaciously to assert that they are monarchs when they are in the greatest poverty; or clothed in gold and purple when destitute of any covering; or that their head is made of clay, their body of glass, or that they are gourds? I should certainly be not less insane than they, were I to regulate my procedure according to examples so extravagant.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/i.php,Descartes,Meditation One
"5. Though this be true, I must nevertheless here consider that I am a man, and that, consequently, I am in the habit of sleeping, and representing to myself in dreams those same things, or even sometimes others less probable, which the insane think are presented to them in their waking moments. How often have I dreamt that I was in these familiar circumstances, that I was dressed, and occupied this place by the fire, when I was lying undressed in bed? At the present moment, however, I certainly look upon this paper with eyes wide awake; the head which I now move is not asleep; I extend this hand consciously and with express purpose, and I perceive it; the occurrences in sleep are not so distinct as all this. But I cannot forget that, at other times I have been deceived in sleep by similar illusions; and, attentively considering those cases, I perceive so clearly that there exist no certain marks by which the state of waking can ever be distinguished from sleep, that I feel greatly astonished; and in amazement I almost persuade myself that I am now dreaming.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/i.php,Descartes,Meditation One
"6. Let us suppose, then, that we are dreaming, and that all these particulars—namely, the opening of the eyes, the motion of the head, the forth- putting of the hands—are merely illusions; and even that we really possess neither an entire body nor hands such as we see. Nevertheless it must be admitted at least that the objects which appear to us in sleep are, as it were, painted representations which could not have been formed unless in the likeness of realities; and, therefore, that those general objects, at all events, namely, eyes, a head, hands, and an entire body, are not simply imaginary, but really existent. For, in truth, painters themselves, even when they study to represent sirens and satyrs by forms the most fantastic and extraordinary, cannot bestow upon them natures absolutely new, but can only make a certain medley of the members of different animals; or if they chance to imagine something so novel that nothing at all similar has ever been seen before, and such as is, therefore, purely fictitious and absolutely false, it is at least certain that the colors of which this is composed are real. And on the same principle, although these general objects, viz. a body, eyes, a head, hands, and the like, be imaginary, we are nevertheless absolutely necessitated to admit the reality at least of some other objects still more simple and universal than these, of which, just as of certain real colors, all those images of things, whether true and real, or false and fantastic, that are found in our consciousness (cogitatio),are formed.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/i.php,Descartes,Meditation One

"8. We will not, therefore, perhaps reason illegitimately if we conclude from this that Physics, Astronomy, Medicine, and all the other sciences that have for their end the consideration of composite objects, are indeed of a doubtful character; but that Arithmetic, Geometry, and the other sciences of the same class, which regard merely the simplest and most general objects, and scarcely inquire whether or not these are really existent, contain somewhat that is certain and indubitable: for whether I am awake or dreaming, it remains true that two and three make five, and that a square has but four sides; nor does it seem possible that truths so apparent can ever fall under a suspicion of falsity or incertitude.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/i.php,Descartes,Meditation One
"9. Nevertheless, the belief that there is a God who is all powerful, and who created me, such as I am, has, for a long time, obtained steady possession of my mind. How, then, do I know that he has not arranged that there should be neither earth, nor sky, nor any extended thing, nor figure, nor magnitude, nor place, providing at the same time, however, for the rise in me of the perceptions of all these objects, and the persuasion that these do not exist otherwise than as I perceive them? And further, as I sometimes think that others are in error respecting matters of which they believe themselves to possess a perfect knowledge, how do I know that I am not also deceived each time I add together two and three, or number the sides of a square, or form some judgment still more simple, if more simple indeed can be imagined? But perhaps Deity has not been willing that I should be thus deceived, for he is said to be supremely good. If, however, it were repugnant to the goodness of Deity to have created me subject to constant deception, it would seem likewise to be contrary to his goodness to allow me to be occasionally deceived; and yet it is clear that this is permitted.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/i.php,Descartes,Meditation One
"10. Some, indeed, might perhaps be found who would be disposed rather to deny the existence of a Being so powerful than to believe that there is nothing certain. But let us for the present refrain from opposing this opinion, and grant that all which is here said of a Deity is fabulous: nevertheless, in whatever way it be supposed that I reach the state in which I exist, whether by fate, or chance, or by an endless series of antecedents and consequents, or by any other means, it is clear (since to be deceived and to err is a certain defect) that the probability of my being so imperfect as to be the constant victim of deception, will be increased exactly in proportion as the power possessed by the cause, to which they assign my origin, is lessened. To these reasonings I have assuredly nothing to reply, but am constrained at last to avow that there is nothing of all that I formerly believed to be true of which it is impossible to doubt, and that not through thoughtlessness or levity, but from cogent and maturely considered reasons; so that henceforward, if I desire to discover anything certain, I ought not the less carefully to refrain from assenting to those same opinions than to what might be shown to be manifestly false.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/i.php,Descartes,Meditation One
"11. But it is not sufficient to have made these observations; care must be taken likewise to keep them in remembrance. For those old and customary opinions perpetually recur— long and familiar usage giving them the right of occupying my mind, even almost against my will, and subduing my belief; nor will I lose the habit of deferring to them and confiding in them so long as I shall consider them to be what in truth they are, viz, opinions to some extent doubtful, as I have already shown, but still highly probable, and such as it is much more reasonable to believe than deny. It is for this reason I am persuaded that I shall not be doing wrong, if, taking an opposite judgment of deliberate design, I become my own deceiver, by supposing, for a time, that all those opinions are entirely false and imaginary, until at length, having thus balanced my old by my new prejudices, my judgment shall no longer be turned aside by perverted usage from the path that may conduct to the perception of truth. For I am assured that, meanwhile, there will arise neither peril nor error from this course, and that I cannot for the present yield too much to distrust, since the end I now seek is not action but knowledge.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/i.php,Descartes,Meditation One
"12. I will suppose, then, not that Deity, who is sovereignly good and the fountain of truth, but that some malignant demon, who is at once exceedingly potent and deceitful, has employed all his artifice to deceive me; I will suppose that the sky, the air, the earth, colors, figures, sounds, and all external things, are nothing better than the illusions of dreams, by means of which this being has laid snares for my credulity; I will consider myself as without hands, eyes, flesh, blood, or any of the senses, and as falsely believing that I am possessed of these; I will continue resolutely fixed in this belief, and if indeed by this means it be not in my power to arrive at the knowledge of truth, I shall at least do what is in my power, viz, suspend my judgment , and guard with settled purpose against giving my assent to what is false, and being imposed upon by this deceiver, whatever be his power and artifice. But this undertaking is arduous, and a certain indolence insensibly leads me back to my ordinary course of life; and just as the captive, who, perchance, was enjoying in his dreams an imaginary liberty, when he begins to suspect that it is but a vision, dreads awakening, and conspires with the agreeable illusions that the deception may be prolonged; so I, of my own accord, fall back into the train of my former beliefs, and fear to arouse myself from my slumber, lest the time of laborious wakefulness that would succeed this quiet rest, in place of bringing any light of day, should prove inadequate to dispel the darkness that will arise from the difficulties that have now been raised.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/i.php,Descartes,Meditation One
"1. The Meditation of yesterday has filled my mind with so many doubts, that it is no longer in my power to forget them. Nor do I see, meanwhile, any principle on which they can be resolved; and, just as if I had fallen all of a sudden into very deep water, I am so greatly disconcerted as to be unable either to plant my feet firmly on the bottom or sustain myself by swimming on the surface. I will, nevertheless, make an effort, and try anew the same path on which I had entered yesterday, that is, proceed by casting aside all that admits of the slightest doubt, not less than if I had discovered it to be absolutely false; and I will continue always in this track until I shall find something that is certain, or at least, if I can do nothing more, until I shall know with certainty that there is nothing certain. Archimedes, that he might transport the entire globe from the place it occupied to another, demanded only a point that was firm and immovable; so, also, I shall be entitled to entertain the highest expectations, if I am fortunate enough to discover only one thing that is certain and indubitable.",No,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/ii.php,Descartes,Meditation Two

I suppose, accordingly, that all the things which I see are false (fictitious); I believe that none of those objects which my fallacious memory represents ever existed; I suppose that I possess no senses; I believe that body, figure, extension, motion, and place are merely fictions of my mind. What is there, then, that can be esteemed true? Perhaps this only, that there is absolutely nothing certain.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/ii.php,Descartes,Meditation Two
"3. But how do I know that there is not something different altogether from the objects I have now enumerated, of which it is impossible to entertain the slightest doubt? Is there not a God, or some being, by whatever name I may designate him, who causes these thoughts to arise in my mind? But why suppose such a being, for it may be I myself am capable of producing them? Am I, then, at least not something? But I before denied that I possessed senses or a body; I hesitate, however, for what follows from that? Am I so dependent on the body and the senses that without these I cannot exist? But I had the persuasion that there was absolutely nothing in the world, that there was no sky and no earth, neither minds nor bodies; was I not, therefore, at the same time, persuaded that I did not exist? Far from it; I assuredly existed, since I was persuaded. But there is I know not what being, who is possessed at once of the highest power and the deepest cunning, who is constantly employing all his ingenuity in deceiving me. Doubtless, then, I exist, since I am deceived; and, let him deceive me as he may, he can never bring it about that I am nothing, so long as I shall be conscious that I am something. So that it must, in fine, be maintained, all things being maturely and carefully considered, that this proposition (pronunciatum ) I am, I exist, is necessarily true each time it is expressed by me, or conceived in my mind.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/ii.php,Descartes,Meditation Two
"4. But I do not yet know with sufficient clearness what I am, though assured that I am; and hence, in the next place, I must take care, lest perchance I inconsiderately substitute some other object in room of what is properly myself, and thus wander from truth, even in that knowledge ( cognition ) which I hold to be of all others the most certain and evident. For this reason, I will now consider anew what I formerly believed myself to be, before I entered on the present train of thought; and of my previous opinion I will retrench all that can in the least be invalidated by the grounds of doubt I have adduced, in order that there may at length remain nothing but what is certain and indubitable.",No,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/ii.php,Descartes,Meditation Two
"5. What then did I formerly think I was? Undoubtedly I judged that I was a man. But what is a man? Shall I say a rational animal? Assuredly not; for it would be necessary forthwith to inquire into what is meant by animal, and what by rational, and thus, from a single question, I should insensibly glide into others, and these more difficult than the first; nor do I now possess enough of leisure to warrant me in wasting my time amid subtleties of this sort. I prefer here to attend to the thoughts that sprung up of themselves in my mind, and were inspired by my own nature alone, when I applied myself to the consideration of what I was. In the first place, then, I thought that I possessed a countenance, hands, arms, and all the fabric of members that appears in a corpse, and which I called by the name of body. It further occurred to me that I was nourished, that I walked, perceived, and thought, and all those actions I referred to the soul; but what the soul itself was I either did not stay to consider, or, if I did, I imagined that it was something extremely rare and subtile, like wind, or flame, or ether, spread through my grosser parts. As regarded the body, I did not even doubt of its nature, but thought I distinctly knew it, and if I had wished to describe it according to the notions I then entertained, I should have explained myself in this manner: By body I understand all that can be terminated by a certain figure; that can be comprised in a certain place, and so fill a certain space as therefrom to exclude every other body; that can be perceived either by touch, sight, hearing, taste, or smell; that can be moved in different ways, not indeed of itself, but by something foreign to it by which it is touched and from which it receives the impression; for the power of self-motion, as likewise that of perceiving and thinking, I held as by no means pertaining to the nature of body; on the contrary, I was somewhat astonished to find such faculties existing in some bodies.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/ii.php,Descartes,Meditation Two
"6. But as to myself, what can I now say that I am, since I suppose there exists an extremely powerful, and, if I may so speak, malignant being, whose whole endeavors are directed toward deceiving me? Can I affirm that I possess any one of all those attributes of which I have lately spoken as belonging to the nature of body? After attentively considering them in my own mind, I find none of them that can properly be said to belong to myself. To recount them were idle and tedious. Let us pass, then, to the attributes of the soul. The first mentioned were the powers of nutrition and walking; but, if it be true that I have no body, it is true likewise that I am capable neither of walking nor of being nourished. Perception is another attribute of the soul; but perception too is impossible without the body; besides, I have frequently, during sleep, believed that I perceived objects which I afterward observed I did not in reality perceive. Thinking is another attribute of the soul; and here I discover what properly belongs to myself. This alone is inseparable from me. I am—I exist: this is certain; but how often? As often as I think; for perhaps it would even happen, if I should wholly cease to think, that I should at the same time altogether cease to be. I now admit nothing that is not necessarily true. I am therefore, precisely speaking, only a thinking thing, that is, a mind (mens sive animus), understanding, or reason, terms whose signification was before unknown to me. I am, however, a real thing, and really existent; but what thing? The answer was, a thinking thing.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/ii.php,Descartes,Meditation Two
"7. The question now arises, am I aught besides? I will stimulate my imagination with a view to discover whether I am not still something more than a thinking being. Now it is plain I am not the assemblage of members called the human body; I am not a thin and penetrating air diffused through all these members, or wind, or flame, or vapor, or breath, or any of all the things I can imagine; for I supposed that all these were not, and, without changing the supposition, I find that I still feel assured of my existence. But it is true, perhaps, that those very things which I suppose to be non-existent, because they are unknown to me, are not in truth different from myself whom I know. This is a point I cannot determine, and do not now enter into any dispute regarding it. I can only judge of things that are known to me: I am conscious that I exist, and I who know that I exist inquire into what I am. It is, however, perfectly certain that the knowledge of my existence, thus precisely taken, is not dependent on things, the existence of which is as yet unknown to me: and consequently it is not dependent on any of the things I can feign in imagination. Moreover, the phrase itself, I frame an image (efffingo), reminds me of my error; for I should in truth frame one if I were to imagine myself to be anything, since to imagine is nothing more than to contemplate the figure or image of a corporeal thing; but I already know that I exist, and that it is possible at the same time that all those images, and in general all that relates to the nature of body, are merely dreams or chimeras. From this I discover that it is not more reasonable to say, I will excite my imagination that I may know more distinctly what I am, than to express myself as follows: I am now awake, and perceive something real; but because my perception is not sufficiently clear, I will of express purpose go to sleep that my dreams may represent to me the object of my perception with more truth and clearness. And, therefore, I know that nothing of all that I can embrace in imagination belongs to the knowledge which I have of myself, and that there is need to recall with the utmost care the mind from this mode of thinking, that it may be able to know its own nature with perfect distinctness.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/ii.php,Descartes,Meditation Two
"8. But what, then, am I? A thinking thing, it has been said. But what is a thinking thing? It is a thing that doubts, understands, conceives, affirms, denies, wills, refuses; that imagines also, and perceives.",No,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/ii.php,Descartes,Meditation Two
"9. Assuredly it is not little, if all these properties belong to my nature. But why should they not belong to it? Am I not that very being who now doubts of almost everything; who, for all that, understands and conceives certain things; who affirms one alone as true, and denies the others; who desires to know more of them, and does not wish to be deceived; who imagines many things, sometimes even despite his will; and is likewise percipient of many, as if through the medium of the senses. Is there nothing of all this as true as that I am, even although I should be always dreaming, and although he who gave me being employed all his ingenuity to deceive me? Is there also any one of these attributes that can be properly distinguished from my thought, or that can be said to be separate from myself? For it is of itself so evident that it is I who doubt, I who understand, and I who desire, that it is here unnecessary to add anything by way of rendering it more clear. And I am as certainly the same being who imagines; for although it may be (as I before supposed) that nothing I imagine is true, still the power of imagination does not cease really to exist in me and to form part of my thought. In fine, I am the same being who perceives, that is, who apprehends certain objects as by the organs of sense, since, in truth, I see light, hear a noise, and feel heat. But it will be said that these presentations are false, and that I am dreaming. Let it be so. At all events it is certain that I seem to see light, hear a noise, and feel heat; this cannot be false, and this is what in me is properly called perceiving (sentire), which is nothing else than thinking.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/ii.php,Descartes,Meditation Two
"10. From this I begin to know what I am with somewhat greater clearness and distinctness than heretofore. But, nevertheless, it still seems to me, and I cannot help believing, that corporeal things, whose images are formed by thought which fall under the senses, and are examined by the same, are known with much greater distinctness than that I know not what part of myself which is not imaginable; although, in truth, it may seem strange to say that I know and comprehend with greater distinctness things whose existence appears to me doubtful, that are unknown, and do not belong to me, than others of whose reality I am persuaded, that are known to me, and appertain to my proper nature; in a word, than myself. But I see clearly what is the state of the case. My mind is apt to wander, and will not yet submit to be restrained within the limits of truth. Let us therefore leave the mind to itself once more, and, according to it every kind of liberty permit it to consider the objects that appear to it from without, in order that, having afterward withdrawn it from these gently and opportunely and fixed it on the consideration of its being and the properties it finds in itsel, it may then be the more easily controlled.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/ii.php,Descartes,Meditation Two
"11. Let us now accordingly consider the objects that are commonly thought to be the most easily, and likewise the most distinctly known, viz, the bodies we touch and see; not, indeed, bodies in general, for these general notions are usually somewhat more confused, but one body in particular. Take, for example, this piece of wax; it is quite fresh, having been but recently taken from the beehive; it has not yet lost the sweetness of the honey it contained; it still retains somewhat of the odor of the flowers from which it was gathered; its color, figure, size, are apparent ( to the sight ); it is hard, cold, easily handled; and sounds when struck upon with the finger. In fine, all that contributes to make a body as distinctly known as possible, is found in the one before us. But, while I am speaking, let it be placed near the fire—what remained of the taste exhales, the smell evaporates, the color changes, its figure is destroyed, its size increases, it becomes liquid, it grows hot, it can hardly be handled, and, although struck upon, it emits no sound. Does the same wax still remain after this change? It must be admitted that it does remain; no one doubts it, or judges otherwise. What, then, was it I knew with so much distinctness in the piece of wax? Assuredly, it could be nothing of all that I observed by means of the senses, since all the things that fell under taste, smell, sight, touch, and hearing are changed, and yet the same wax remains.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/ii.php,Descartes,Meditation Two
"12. It was perhaps what I now think, viz, that this wax was neither the sweetness of honey, the pleasant odor of flowers, the whiteness, the figure, nor the sound, but only a body that a little before appeared to me conspicuous under these forms, and which is now perceived under others. But, to speak precisely, what is it that I imagine when I think of it in this way? Let it be attentively considered, and, retrenching all that does not belong to the wax, let us see what remains. There certainly remains nothing, except something extended, flexible, and movable. But what is meant by flexible and movable? Is it not that I imagine that the piece of wax, being round, is capable of becoming square, or of passing from a square into a triangular figure? Assuredly such is not the case, because I conceive that it admits of an infinity of similar changes; and I am, moreover, unable to compass this infinity by imagination, and consequently this conception which I have of the wax is not the product of the faculty of imagination. But what now is this extension? Is it not also unknown? for it becomes greater when the wax is melted, greater when it is boiled, and greater still when the heat increases; and I should not conceive clearly and according to truth, the wax as it is, if I did not suppose that the piece we are considering admitted even of a wider variety of extension than I ever imagined, I must, therefore, admit that I cannot even comprehend by imagination what the piece of wax is, and that it is the mind alone ( mens, Lat., entendement, F.) which perceives it. I speak of one piece in particular; for as to wax in general, this is still more evident. But what is the piece of wax that can be perceived only by the understanding or mind? It is certainly the same which I see, touch, imagine; and, in fine, it is the same which, from the beginning, I believed it to be. But (and this it is of moment to observe) the perception of it is neither an act of sight, of touch, nor of imagination, and never was either of these, though it might formerly seem so, but is simply an intuition (inspectio) of the mind, which may be imperfect and confused, as it formerly was, or very clear and distinct, as it is at present, according as the attention is more or less directed to the elements which it contains, and of which it is composed.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/ii.php,Descartes,Meditation Two
"13. But, meanwhile, I feel greatly astonished when I observe the weakness of my mind, and its proneness to error. For although, without at all giving expression to what I think, I consider all this in my own mind, words yet occasionally impede my progress, and I am almost led into error by the terms of ordinary language. We say, for example, that we see the same wax when it is before us, and not that we judge it to be the same from its retaining the same color and figure: whence I should forthwith be disposed to conclude that the wax is known by the act of sight, and not by the intuition of the mind alone, were it not for the analogous instance of human beings passing on in the street below, as observed from a window. In this case I do not fail to say that I see the men themselves, just as I say that I see the wax; and yet what do I see from the window beyond hats and cloaks that might cover artificial machines, whose motions might be determined by springs? But I judge that there are human beings from these appearances, and thus I comprehend, by the faculty of judgment alone which is in the mind, what I believed I saw with my eyes.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/ii.php,Descartes,Meditation Two
"14. The man who makes it his aim to rise to knowledge superior to the common, ought to be ashamed to seek occasions of doubting from the vulgar forms of speech: instead, therefore, of doing this, I shall proceed with the matter in hand, and inquire whether I had a clearer and more perfect perception of the piece of wax when I first saw it, and when I thought I knew it by means of the external sense itself, or, at all events, by the common sense (sensus communis), as it is called, that is, by the imaginative faculty; or whether I rather apprehend it more clearly at present, after having examined with greater care, both what it is, and in what way it can be known. It would certainly be ridiculous to entertain any doubt on this point. For what, in that first perception, was there distinct? What did I perceive which any animal might not have perceived? But when I distinguish the wax from its exterior forms, and when, as if I had stripped it of its vestments, I consider it quite naked, it is certain, although some error may still be found in my judgment, that I cannot, nevertheless, thus apprehend it without possessing a human mind.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/ii.php,Descartes,Meditation Two
"15. But finally, what shall I say of the mind itself, that is, of myself? for as yet I do not admit that I am anything but mind. What, then! I who seem to possess so distinct an apprehension of the piece of wax, do I not know myself, both with greater truth and certitude, and also much more distinctly and clearly? For if I judge that the wax exists because I see it, it assuredly follows, much more evidently, that I myself am or exist, for the same reason: for it is possible that what I see may not in truth be wax, and that I do not even possess eyes with which to see anything; but it cannot be that when I see, or, which comes to the same thing, when I think I see, I myself who think am nothing. So likewise, if I judge that the wax exists because I touch it, it will still also follow that I am; and if I determine that my imagination, or any other cause, whatever it be, persuades me of the existence of the wax, I will still draw the same conclusion. And what is here remarked of the piece of wax, is applicable to all the other things that are external to me. And further, if the notion or perception of wax appeared to me more precise and distinct, after that not only sight and touch, but many other causes besides, rendered it manifest to my apprehension, with how much greater distinctness must I now know myself, since all the reasons that contribute to the knowledge of the nature of wax, or of any body whatever, manifest still better the nature of my mind? And there are besides so many other things in the mind itself that contribute to the illustration of its nature, that those dependent on the body, to which I have here referred, scarcely merit to be taken into account.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/ii.php,Descartes,Meditation Two
"16. But, in conclusion, I find I have insensibly reverted to the point I desired; for, since it is now manifest to me that bodies themselves are not properly perceived by the senses nor by the faculty of imagination, but by the intellect alone; and since they are not perceived because they are seen and touched, but only because they are understood or rightly comprehended by thought , I readily discover that there is nothing more easily or clearly apprehended than my own mind. But because it is difficult to rid one's self so promptly of an opinion to which one has been long accustomed, it will be desirable to tarry for some time at this stage, that, by long continued meditation, I may more deeply impress upon my memory this new knowledge.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/ii.php,Descartes,Meditation Two
"1. I will now close my eyes, I will stop my ears, I will turn away my senses from their objects, I will even efface from my consciousness all the images of corporeal things; or at least, because this can hardly be accomplished, I will consider them as empty and false; and thus, holding converse only with myself, and closely examining my nature, I will endeavor to obtain by degrees a more intimate and familiar knowledge of myself. I am a thinking ( conscious ) thing, that is, a being who doubts, affirms, denies, knows a few objects, and is ignorant of many,— who loves, hates, wills, refuses, who imagines likewise, and perceives; for, as I before remarked, although the things which I perceive or imagine are perhaps nothing at all apart from me and in themselves, I am nevertheless assured that those modes of consciousness which I call perceptions and imaginations, in as far only as they are modes of consciousness, exist in me.",No,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"2. And in the little I have said I think I have summed up all that I really know, or at least all that up to this time I was aware I knew. Now, as I am endeavoring to extend my knowledge more widely, I will use circumspection, and consider with care whether I can still discover in myself anything further which I have not yet hitherto observed. I am certain that I am a thinking thing; but do I not therefore likewise know what is required to render me certain of a truth? In this first knowledge, doubtless, there is nothing that gives me assurance of its truth except the clear and distinct perception of what I affirm, which would not indeed be sufficient to give me the assurance that what I say is true, if it could ever happen that anything I thus clearly and distinctly perceived should prove false; and accordingly it seems to me that I may now take as a general rule, that all that is very clearly and distinctly apprehended (conceived) is true.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"3. Nevertheless I before received and admitted many things as wholly certain and manifest, which yet I afterward found to be doubtful. What, then, were those? They were the earth, the sky, the stars, and all the other objects which I was in the habit of perceiving by the senses. But what was it that I clearly and distinctly perceived in them? Nothing more than that the ideas and the thoughts of those objects were presented to my mind. And even now I do not deny that these ideas are found in my mind. But there was yet another thing which I affirmed, and which, from having been accustomed to believe it, I thought I clearly perceived, although, in truth, I did not perceive it at all; I mean the existence of objects external to me, from which those ideas proceeded, and to which they had a perfect resemblance; and it was here I was mistaken, or if I judged correctly, this assuredly was not to be traced to any knowledge I possessed (the force of my perception, Lat.).",No,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"4. But when I considered any matter in arithmetic and geometry, that was very simple and easy, as, for example, that two and three added together make five, and things of this sort, did I not view them with at least sufficient clearness to warrant me in affirming their truth? Indeed, if I afterward judged that we ought to doubt of these things, it was for no other reason than because it occurred to me that a God might perhaps have given me such a nature as that I should be deceived, even respecting the matters that appeared to me the most evidently true. But as often as this preconceived opinion of the sovereign power of a God presents itself to my mind, I am constrained to admit that it is easy for him, if he wishes it, to cause me to err, even in matters where I think I possess the highest evidence; and, on the other hand, as often as I direct my attention to things which I think I apprehend with great clearness, I am so persuaded of their truth that I naturally break out into expressions such as these: Deceive me who may, no one will yet ever be able to bring it about that I am not, so long as I shall be conscious that I am, or at any future time cause it to be true that I have never been, it being now true that I am, or make two and three more or less than five, in supposing which, and other like absurdities, I discover a manifest contradiction. And in truth, as I have no ground for believing that Deity is deceitful, and as, indeed, I have not even considered the reasons by which the existence of a Deity of any kind is established, the ground of doubt that rests only on this supposition is very slight, and, so to speak, metaphysical. But, that I may be able wholly to remove it, I must inquire whether there is a God, as soon as an opportunity of doing so shall present itself; and if I find that there is a God, I must examine likewise whether he can be a deceiver; for, without the knowledge of these two truths, I do not see that I can ever be certain of anything. And that I may be enabled to examine this without interrupting the order of meditation I have proposed to myself which is, to pass by degrees from the notions that I shall find first in my mind to those I shall afterward discover in it, it is necessary at this stage to divide all my thoughts into certain classes, and to consider in which of these classes truth and error are, strictly speaking, to be found.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"5. Of my thoughts some are, as it were, images of things, and to these alone properly belongs the name IDEA; as when I think represent to my mind a man, a chimera, the sky, an angel or God. Others, again, have certain other forms; as when I will, fear, affirm, or deny, I always, indeed, apprehend something as the object of my thought, but I also embrace in thought something more than the representation of the object; and of this class of thoughts some are called volitions or affections, and others judgments.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"6. Now, with respect to ideas, if these are considered only in themselves, and are not referred to any object beyond them, they cannot, properly speaking, be false; for, whether I imagine a goat or chimera, it is not less true that I imagine the one than the other. Nor need we fear that falsity may exist in the will or affections; for, although I may desire objects that are wrong, and even that never existed, it is still true that I desire them. There thus only remain our judgments, in which we must take diligent heed that we be not deceived. But the chief and most ordinary error that arises in them consists in judging that the ideas which are in us are like or conformed to the things that are external to us; for assuredly, if we but considered the ideas themselves as certain modes of our thought (consciousness), without referring them to anything beyond, they would hardly afford any occasion of error.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three

But among these ideas, some appear to me to be innate, others adventitious, and others to be made by myself (factitious); for, as I have the power of conceiving what is called a thing, or a truth, or a thought, it seems to me that I hold this power from no other source than my own nature; but if I now hear a noise, if I see the sun, or if I feel heat, I have all along judged that these sensations proceeded from certain objects existing out of myself; and, in fine, it appears to me that sirens, hippogryphs, and the like, are inventions of my own mind. But I may even perhaps come to be of opinion that all my ideas are of the class which I call adventitious, or that they are all innate, or that they are all factitious; for I have not yet clearly discovered their true origin.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"8. What I have here principally to do is to consider, with reference to those that appear to come from certain objects without me, what grounds there are for thinking them like these objects. The first of these grounds is that it seems to me I am so taught by nature; and the second that I am conscious that those ideas are not dependent on my will, and therefore not on myself, for they are frequently presented to me against my will, as at present, whether I will or not, I feel heat; and I am thus persuaded that this sensation or idea (sensum vel ideam) of heat is produced in me by something different from myself, viz., by the heat of the fire by which I sit. And it is very reasonable to suppose that this object impresses me with its own likeness rather than any other thing.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"9. But I must consider whether these reasons are sufficiently strong and convincing. When I speak of being taught by nature in this matter, I understand by the word nature only a certain spontaneous impetus that impels me to believe in a resemblance between ideas and their objects, and not a natural light that affords a knowledge of its truth. But these two things are widely different; for what the natural light shows to be true can be in no degree doubtful, as, for example, that I am because I doubt, and other truths of the like kind; inasmuch as I possess no other faculty whereby to distinguish truth from error, which can teach me the falsity of what the natural light declares to be true, and which is equally trustworthy; but with respect to seemingly natural impulses, I have observed, when the question related to the choice of right or wrong in action, that they frequently led me to take the worse part; nor do I see that I have any better ground for following them in what relates to truth and error.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"10. Then, with respect to the other reason, which is that because these ideas do not depend on my will, they must arise from objects existing without me, I do not find it more convincing than the former, for just as those natural impulses, of which I have lately spoken, are found in me, notwithstanding that they are not always in harmony with my will, so likewise it may be that I possess some power not sufficiently known to myself capable of producing ideas without the aid of external objects, and, indeed, it has always hitherto appeared to me that they are formed during sleep, by some power of this nature, without the aid of aught external.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"11. And, in fine, although I should grant that they proceeded from those objects, it is not a necessary consequence that they must be like them. On the contrary, I have observed, in a number of instances, that there was a great difference between the object and its idea. Thus, for example, I find in my mind two wholly diverse ideas of the sun; the one, by which it appears to me extremely small draws its origin from the senses, and should be placed in the class of adventitious ideas; the other, by which it seems to be many times larger than the whole earth, is taken up on astronomical grounds, that is, elicited from certain notions born with me, or is framed by myself in some other manner. These two ideas cannot certainly both resemble the same sun; and reason teaches me that the one which seems to have immediately emanated from it is the most unlike.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"12. And these things sufficiently prove that hitherto it has not been from a certain and deliberate judgment, but only from a sort of blind impulse, that I believed existence of certain things different from myself, which, by the organs of sense, or by whatever other means it might be, conveyed their ideas or images into my mind and impressed it with their likenesses.",No,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"13. But there is still another way of inquiring whether, of the objects whose ideas are in my mind, there are any that exist out of me. If ideas are taken in so far only as they are certain modes of consciousness, I do not remark any difference or inequality among them, and all seem, in the same manner, to proceed from myself; but, considering them as images, of which one represents one thing and another a different, it is evident that a great diversity obtains among them. For, without doubt, those that represent substances are something more, and contain in themselves, so to speak, more objective reality that is, participate by representation in higher degrees of being or perfection, than those that represent only modes or accidents; and again, the idea by which I conceive a God sovereign, eternal, infinite, immutable, all-knowing, all-powerful, and the creator of all things that are out of himself, this, I say, has certainly in it more objective reality than those ideas by which finite substances are represented.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"14. Now, it is manifest by the natural light that there must at least be as much reality in the efficient and total cause as in its effect; for whence can the effect draw its reality if not from its cause? And how could the cause communicate to it this reality unless it possessed it in itself? And hence it follows, not only that what is cannot be produced by what is not, but likewise that the more perfect, in other words, that which contains in itself more reality, cannot be the effect of the less perfect; and this is not only evidently true of those effects, whose reality is actual or formal, but likewise of ideas, whose reality is only considered as objective. Thus, for example, the stone that is not yet in existence, not only cannot now commence to be, unless it be produced by that which possesses in itself, formally or eminently, all that enters into its composition, in other words, by that which contains in itself the same properties that are in the stone, or others superior to them; and heat can only be produced in a subject that was before devoid of it, by a cause that is of an order, degree or kind, at least as perfect as heat; and so of the others. But further, even the idea of the heat, or of the stone, cannot exist in me unless it be put there by a cause that contains, at least, as much reality as I conceive existent in the heat or in the stone for although that cause may not transmit into my idea anything of its actual or formal reality, we ought not on this account to imagine that it is less real; but we ought to consider that, as every idea is a work of the mind, its nature is such as of itself to demand no other formal reality than that which it borrows from our consciousness, of which it is but a mode that is, a manner or way of thinking. But in order that an idea may contain this objective reality rather than that, it must doubtless derive it from some cause in which is found at least as much formal reality as the idea contains of objective; for, if we suppose that there is found in an idea anything which was not in its cause, it must of course derive this from nothing. But, however imperfect may be the mode of existence by which a thing is objectively or by representation in the understanding by its idea, we certainly cannot, for all that, allege that this mode of existence is nothing, nor, consequently, that the idea owes its origin to nothing.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"15. Nor must it be imagined that, since the reality which considered in these ideas is only objective, the same reality need not be formally (actually) in the causes of these ideas, but only objectively: for, just as the mode of existing objectively belongs to ideas by their peculiar nature, so likewise the mode of existing formally appertains to the causes of these ideas (at least to the first and principal), by their peculiar nature. And although an idea may give rise to another idea, this regress cannot, nevertheless, be infinite; we must in the end reach a first idea, the cause of which is, as it were, the archetype in which all the reality or perfection that is found objectively or by representation in these ideas is contained formally and in act. I am thus clearly taught by the natural light that ideas exist in me as pictures or images, which may, in truth, readily fall short of the perfection of the objects from which they are taken, but can never contain anything greater or more perfect.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"16. And in proportion to the time and care with which I examine all those matters, the conviction of their truth brightens and becomes distinct. But, to sum up, what conclusion shall I draw from it all? It is this: if the objective reality or perfection of any one of my ideas be such as clearly to convince me, that this same reality exists in me neither formally nor eminently, and if, as follows from this, I myself cannot be the cause of it, it is a necessary consequence that I am not alone in the world, but that there is besides myself some other being who exists as the cause of that idea; while, on the contrary, if no such idea be found in my mind, I shall have no sufficient ground of assurance of the existence of any other being besides myself, for, after a most careful search, I have, up to this moment, been unable to discover any other ground.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"17. But, among these my ideas, besides that which represents myself, respecting which there can be here no difficulty, there is one that represents a God; others that represent corporeal and inanimate things; others angels; others animals; and, finally, there are some that represent men like myself",No,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"18. But with respect to the ideas that represent other men, or animals, or angels, I can easily suppose that they were formed by the mingling and composition of the other ideas which I have of myself, of corporeal things, and of God, although they were, apart from myself, neither men, animals, nor angels.",No,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"19. And with regard to the ideas of corporeal objects, I never discovered in them anything so great or excellent which I myself did not appear capable of originating; for, by considering these ideas closely and scrutinizing them individually, in the same way that I yesterday examined the idea of wax, I find that there is but little in them that is clearly and distinctly perceived. As belonging to the class of things that are clearly apprehended, I recognize the following, viz, magnitude or extension in length, breadth, and depth; figure, which results from the termination of extension; situation, which bodies of diverse figures preserve with reference to each other; and motion or the change of situation; to which may be added substance, duration, and number. But with regard to light, colors, sounds, odors, tastes, heat, cold, and the other tactile qualities, they are thought with so much obscurity and confusion, that I cannot determine even whether they are true or false; in other words, whether or not the ideas I have of these qualities are in truth the ideas of real objects. For although I before remarked that it is only in judgments that formal falsity, or falsity properly so called, can be met with, there may nevertheless be found in ideas a certain material falsity, which arises when they represent what is nothing as if it were something. Thus, for example, the ideas I have of cold and heat are so far from being clear and distinct, that I am unable from them to discover whether cold is only the privation of heat, or heat the privation of cold; or whether they are or are not real qualities: and since, ideas being as it were images there can be none that does not seem to us to represent some object, the idea which represents cold as something real and positive will not improperly be called false, if it be correct to say that cold is nothing but a privation of heat; and so in other cases.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"20. To ideas of this kind, indeed, it is not necessary that I should assign any author besides myself: for if they are false, that is, represent objects that are unreal, the natural light teaches me that they proceed from nothing; in other words, that they are in me only because something is wanting to the perfection of my nature; but if these ideas are true, yet because they exhibit to me so little reality that I cannot even distinguish the object represented from nonbeing, I do not see why I should not be the author of them.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"21. With reference to those ideas of corporeal things that are clear and distinct, there are some which, as appears to me, might have been taken from the idea I have of myself, as those of substance, duration, number, and the like. For when I think that a stone is a substance, or a thing capable of existing of itself, and that I am likewise a substance, although I conceive that I am a thinking and non-extended thing, and that the stone, on the contrary, is extended and unconscious, there being thus the greatest diversity between the two concepts, yet these two ideas seem to have this in common that they both represent substances. In the same way, when I think of myself as now existing, and recollect besides that I existed some time ago, and when I am conscious of various thoughts whose number I know, I then acquire the ideas of duration and number, which I can afterward transfer to as many objects as I please. With respect to the other qualities that go to make up the ideas of corporeal objects, viz, extension, figure, situation, and motion, it is true that they are not formally in me, since I am merely a thinking being; but because they are only certain modes of substance, and because I myself am a substance, it seems possible that they may be contained in me eminently.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"22. There only remains, therefore, the idea of God, in which I must consider whether there is anything that cannot be supposed to originate with myself. By the name God, I understand a substance infinite, eternal, immutable, independent, all-knowing, all-powerful, and by which I myself, and every other thing that exists, if any such there be, were created. But these properties are so great and excellent, that the more attentively I consider them the less I feel persuaded that the idea I have of them owes its origin to myself alone. And thus it is absolutely necessary to conclude, from all that I have before said, that God exists.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"23. For though the idea of substance be in my mind owing to this, that I myself am a substance, I should not, however, have the idea of an infinite substance, seeing I am a finite being, unless it were given me by some substance in reality infinite.",No,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"24. And I must not imagine that I do not apprehend the infinite by a true idea, but only by the negation of the finite, in the same way that I comprehend repose and darkness by the negation of motion and light: since, on the contrary, I clearly perceive that there is more reality in the infinite substance than in the finite, and therefore that in some way I possess the perception (notion) of the infinite before that of the finite, that is, the perception of God before that of myself, for how could I know that I doubt, desire, or that something is wanting to me, and that I am not wholly perfect, if I possessed no idea of a being more perfect than myself, by comparison of which I knew the deficiencies of my nature?",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"25. And it cannot be said that this idea of God is perhaps materially false, and consequently that it may have arisen from nothing in other words, that it may exist in me from my imperfections as I before said of the ideas of heat and cold, and the like: for, on the contrary, as this idea is very clear and distinct, and contains in itself more objective reality than any other, there can be no one of itself more true, or less open to the suspicion of falsity. The idea, I say, of a being supremely perfect, and infinite, is in the highest degree true; for although, perhaps, we may imagine that such a being does not exist, we cannot, nevertheless, suppose that his idea represents nothing real, as I have already said of the idea of cold. It is likewise clear and distinct in the highest degree, since whatever the mind clearly and distinctly conceives as real or true, and as implying any perfection, is contained entire in this idea. And this is true, nevertheless, although I do not comprehend the infinite, and although there may be in God an infinity of things that I cannot comprehend, nor perhaps even compass by thought in any way; for it is of the nature of the infinite that it should not be comprehended by the finite; and it is enough that I rightly understand this, and judge that all which I clearly perceive, and in which I know there is some perfection, and perhaps also an infinity of properties of which I am ignorant, are formally or eminently in God, in order that the idea I have of him may be come the most true, clear, and distinct of all the ideas in my mind.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"26. But perhaps I am something more than I suppose myself to be, and it may be that all those perfections which I attribute to God, in some way exist potentially in me, although they do not yet show themselves, and are not reduced to act. Indeed, I am already conscious that my knowledge is being increased and perfected by degrees; and I see nothing to prevent it from thus gradually increasing to infinity, nor any reason why, after such increase and perfection, I should not be able thereby to acquire all the other perfections of the Divine nature; nor, in fine, why the power I possess of acquiring those perfections, if it really now exist in me, should not be sufficient to produce the ideas of them.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"27. Yet, on looking more closely into the matter, I discover that this cannot be; for, in the first place, although it were true that my knowledge daily acquired new degrees of perfection, and although there were potentially in my nature much that was not as yet actually in it, still all these excellences make not the slightest approach to the idea I have of the Deity, in whom there is no perfection merely potentially but all actually existent; for it is even an unmistakable token of imperfection in my knowledge, that it is augmented by degrees. Further, although my knowledge increase more and more, nevertheless I am not, therefore, induced to think that it will ever be actually infinite, since it can never reach that point beyond which it shall be incapable of further increase. But I conceive God as actually infinite, so that nothing can be added to his perfection. And, in fine, I readily perceive that the objective being of an idea cannot be produced by a being that is merely potentially existent, which, properly speaking, is nothing, but only by a being existing formally or actually.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"28. And, truly, I see nothing in all that I have now said which it is not easy for any one, who shall carefully consider it, to discern by the natural light; but when I allow my attention in some degree to relax, the vision of my mind being obscured, and, as it were, blinded by the images of sensible objects, I do not readily remember the reason why the idea of a being more perfect than myself, must of necessity have proceeded from a being in reality more perfect. On this account I am here desirous to inquire further, whether I, who possess this idea of God, could exist supposing there were no God.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"29. And I ask, from whom could I, in that case, derive my existence? Perhaps from myself, or from my parents, or from some other causes less perfect than God; for anything more perfect, or even equal to God, cannot be thought or imagined.",No,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"30. But if I were independent of every other existence, and were myself the author of my being, I should doubt of nothing, I should desire nothing, and, in fine, no perfection would be awanting to me; for I should have bestowed upon myself every perfection of which I possess the idea, and I should thus be God. And it must not be imagined that what is now wanting to me is perhaps of more difficult acquisition than that of which I am already possessed; for, on the contrary, it is quite manifest that it was a matter of much higher difficulty that I, a thinking being, should arise from nothing, than it would be for me to acquire the knowledge of many things of which I am ignorant, and which are merely the accidents of a thinking substance; and certainly, if I possessed of myself the greater perfection of which I have now spoken in other words, if I were the author of my own existence, I would not at least have denied to myself things that may be more easily obtained as that infinite variety of knowledge of which I am at present destitute. I could not, indeed, have denied to myself any property which I perceive is contained in the idea of God, because there is none of these that seems to me to be more difficult to make or acquire; and if there were any that should happen to be more difficult to acquire, they would certainly appear so to me (supposing that I myself were the source of the other things I possess), because I should discover in them a limit to my power.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"31. And though I were to suppose that I always was as I now am, I should not, on this ground, escape the force of these reasonings, since it would not follow, even on this supposition, that no author of my existence needed to be sought after. For the whole time of my life may be divided into an infinity of parts, each of which is in no way dependent on any other; and, accordingly, because I was in existence a short time ago, it does not follow that I must now exist, unless in this moment some cause create me anew as it were, that is, conserve me. In truth, it is perfectly clear and evident to all who will attentively consider the nature of duration, that the conservation of a substance, in each moment of its duration, requires the same power and act that would be necessary to create it, supposing it were not yet in existence; so that it is manifestly a dictate of the natural light that conservation and creation differ merely in respect of our mode of thinking and not in reality.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"32. All that is here required, therefore, is that I interrogate myself to discover whether I possess any power by means of which I can bring it about that I, who now am, shall exist a moment afterward: for, since I am merely a thinking thing (or since, at least, the precise question, in the meantime, is only of that part of myself ), if such a power resided in me, I should, without doubt, be conscious of it; but I am conscious of no such power, and thereby I manifestly know that I am dependent upon some being different from myself.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"33. But perhaps the being upon whom I am dependent is not God, and I have been produced either by my parents, or by some causes less perfect than Deity. This cannot be: for, as I before said, it is perfectly evident that there must at least be as much reality in the cause as in its effect; and accordingly, since I am a thinking thing and possess in myself an idea of God, whatever in the end be the cause of my existence, it must of necessity be admitted that it is likewise a thinking being, and that it possesses in itself the idea and all the perfections I attribute to Deity. Then it may again be inquired whether this cause owes its origin and existence to itself, or to some other cause. For if it be self-existent, it follows, from what I have before laid down, that this cause is God; for, since it possesses the perfection of self-existence, it must likewise, without doubt, have the power of actually possessing every perfection of which it has the idea—in other words, all the perfections I conceive to belong to God. But if it owe its existence to another cause than itself, we demand again, for a similar reason, whether this second cause exists of itself or through some other, until, from stage to stage, we at length arrive at an ultimate cause, which will be God.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"34. And it is quite manifest that in this matter there can be no infinite regress of causes, seeing that the question raised respects not so much the cause which once produced me, as that by which I am at this present moment conserved.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"35. Nor can it be supposed that several causes concurred in my production, and that from one I received the idea of one of the perfections I attribute to Deity, and from another the idea of some other, and thus that all those perfections are indeed found somewhere in the universe, but do not all exist together in a single being who is God; for, on the contrary, the unity, the simplicity, or inseparability of all the properties of Deity, is one of the chief perfections I conceive him to possess; and the idea of this unity of all the perfections of Deity could certainly not be put into my mind by any cause from which I did not likewise receive the ideas of all the other perfections; for no power could enable me to embrace them in an inseparable unity, without at the same time giving me the knowledge of what they were and of their existence in a particular mode.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"36. Finally, with regard to my parents from whom it appears I sprung , although all that I believed respecting them be true, it does not, nevertheless, follow that I am conserved by them, or even that I was produced by them, in so far as I am a thinking being. All that, at the most, they contributed to my origin was the giving of certain dispositions ( modifications ) to the matter in which I have hitherto judged that I or my mind, which is what alone I now consider to be myself, is inclosed; and thus there can here be no difficulty with respect to them, and it is absolutely necessary to conclude from this alone that I am, and possess the idea of a being absolutely perfect, that is, of God, that his existence is most clearly demonstrated.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"37. There remains only the inquiry as to the way in which I received this idea from God; for I have not drawn it from the senses, nor is it even presented to me unexpectedly, as is usual with the ideas of sensible objects, when these are presented or appear to be presented to the external organs of the senses; it is not even a pure production or fiction of my mind, for it is not in my power to take from or add to it; and consequently there but remains the alternative that it is innate, in the same way as is the idea of myself.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"38. And, in truth, it is not to be wondered at that God, at my creation, implanted this idea in me, that it might serve, as it were, for the mark of the workman impressed on his work; and it is not also necessary that the mark should be something different from the work itself; but considering only that God is my creator, it is highly probable that he in some way fashioned me after his own image and likeness, and that I perceive this likeness, in which is contained the idea of God, by the same faculty by which I apprehend myself, in other words, when I make myself the object of reflection, I not only find that I am an incomplete, imperfect and dependent being, and one who unceasingly aspires after something better and greater than he is; but, at the same time, I am assured likewise that he upon whom I am dependent possesses in himself all the goods after which I aspire and the ideas of which I find in my mind, and that not merely indefinitely and potentially, but infinitely and actually, and that he is thus God. And the whole force of the argument of which I have here availed myself to establish the existence of God, consists in this, that I perceive I could not possibly be of such a nature as I am, and yet have in my mind the idea of a God, if God did not in reality exist—this same God, I say, whose idea is in my mind—that is, a being who possesses all those lofty perfections, of which the mind may have some slight conception, without, however, being able fully to comprehend them, and who is wholly superior to all defect and has nothing that marks imperfection: whence it is sufficiently manifest that he cannot be a deceiver, since it is a dictate of the natural light that all fraud and deception spring from some defect.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"39. But before I examine this with more attention, and pass on to the consideration of other truths that may be evolved out of it, I think it proper to remain here for some time in the contemplation of God himself—that I may ponder at leisure his marvelous attributes—and behold, admire, and adore the beauty of this light so unspeakably great, as far, at least, as the strength of my mind, which is to some degree dazzled by the sight, will permit. For just as we learn by faith that the supreme felicity of another life consists in the contemplation of the Divine majesty alone, so even now we learn from experience that a like meditation, though incomparably less perfect, is the source of the highest satisfaction of which we are susceptible in this life.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iii.php,Descartes,Meditation Three
"1. I have been habituated these bygone days to detach my mind from the senses, and I have accurately observed that there is exceedingly little which is known with certainty respecting corporeal objects, that we know much more of the human mind, and still more of God himself. I am thus able now without difficulty to abstract my mind from the contemplation of sensible or imaginable objects, and apply it to those which, as disengaged from all matter, are purely intelligible. And certainly the idea I have of the human mind in so far as it is a thinking thing, and not extended in length, breadth, and depth, and participating in none of the properties of body, is incomparably more distinct than the idea of any corporeal object; and when I consider that I doubt, in other words, that I am an incomplete and dependent being, the idea of a complete and independent being, that is to say of God, occurs to my mind with so much clearness and distinctness, and from the fact alone that this idea is found in me, or that I who possess it exist, the conclusions that God exists, and that my own existence, each moment of its continuance, is absolutely dependent upon him, are so manifest, as to lead me to believe it impossible that the human mind can know anything with more clearness and certitude. And now I seem to discover a path that will conduct us from the contemplation of the true God, in whom are contained all the treasures of science and wisdom, to the knowledge of the other things in the universe.",No,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iv.php,Descartes,Meditation Four

For, in the first place, I discover that it is impossible for him ever to deceive me, for in all fraud and deceit there is a certain imperfection: and although it may seem that the ability to deceive is a mark of subtlety or power, yet the will testifies without doubt of malice and weakness; and such, accordingly, cannot be found in God.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iv.php,Descartes,Meditation Four
"3.In the next place, I am conscious that I possess a certain faculty of judging or discerning truth from error, which I doubtless received from God, along with whatever else is mine; and since it is impossible that he should will to deceive me, it is likewise certain that he has not given me a faculty that will ever lead me into error, provided I use it aright.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iv.php,Descartes,Meditation Four
"4. And there would remain no doubt on this head, did it not seem to follow from this, that I can never therefore be deceived; for if all I possess be from God, and if he planted in me no faculty that is deceitful, it seems to follow that I can never fall into error. Accordingly, it is true that when I think only of God (when I look upon myself as coming from God, Fr. ), and turn wholly to him, I discover in mysel no cause of error or falsity: but immediately thereafter, recurring to myself, experience assures me that I am nevertheless subject to innumerable errors. When I come to inquire into the cause of these, I observe that there is not only present to my consciousness a real and positive idea of God, or of a being supremely perfect, but also, so to speak, a certain negative idea of nothing, in other words, of that which is at an infinite distance from every sort of perfection, and that I am, as it were, a mean between God and nothing, or placed in such a way between absolute existence and non-existence, that there is in truth nothing in me to lead me into error, in so far as an absolute being is my creator; but that, on the other hand, as I thus likewise participate in some degree of nothing or of nonbeing, in other words, as I am not myself the supreme Being, and as I am wanting in many perfections, it is not surprising I should fall into error. And I hence discern that error, so far as error is not something real, which depends for its existence on God, but is simply defect; and therefore that, in order to fall into it, it is not necessary God should have given me a faculty expressly for this end, but that my being deceived arises from the circumstance that the power which God has given me of discerning truth from error is not infinite.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iv.php,Descartes,Meditation Four
"5. Nevertheless this is not yet quite satisfactory; for error is not a pure negation, in other words, it is not the simple deficiency or want of some knowledge which is not due, but the privation or want of some knowledge which it would seem I ought to possess. But, on considering the nature of God, it seems impossible that he should have planted in his creature any faculty not perfect in its kind, that is, wanting in some perfection due to it: for if it be true, that in proportion to the skill of the maker the perfection of his work is greater, what thing can have been produced by the supreme Creator of the universe that is not absolutely perfect in all its parts? And assuredly there is no doubt that God could have created me such as that I should never be deceived; it is certain, likewise, that he always wills what is best: is it better, then, that I should be capable of being deceived than that I should not?",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iv.php,Descartes,Meditation Four
"6. Considering this more attentively the first thing that occurs to me is the reflection that I must not be surprised if I am not always capable of comprehending the reasons why God acts as he does; nor must I doubt of his existence because I find, perhaps, that there are several other things besides the present respecting which I understand neither why nor how they were created by him; for, knowing already that my nature is extremely weak and limited, and that the nature of God, on the other hand, is immense, incomprehensible, and infinite, I have no longer any difficulty in discerning that there is an infinity of things in his power whose causes transcend the grasp of my mind: and this consideration alone is sufficient to convince me, that the whole class of final causes is of no avail in physical or natural things; for it appears to me that I cannot, without exposing myself to the charge of temerity, seek to discover the impenetrable ends of Deity.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iv.php,Descartes,Meditation Four
"7. It further occurs to me that we must not consider only one creature apart from the others, if we wish to determine the perfection of the works of Deity, but generally all his creatures together; for the same object that might perhaps, with some show of reason, be deemed highly imperfect if it were alone in the world, may for all that be the most perfect possible, considered as forming part of the whole universe: and although, as it was my purpose to doubt of everything, I only as yet know with certainty my own existence and that of God, nevertheless, after having remarked the infinite power of Deity, I cannot deny that we may have produced many other objects, or at least that he is able to produce them, so that I may occupy a place in the relation of a part to the great whole of his creatures.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iv.php,Descartes,Meditation Four
"8. Whereupon, regarding myself more closely, and considering what my errors are (which alone testify to the existence of imperfection in me), I observe that these depend on the concurrence of two causes, viz, the faculty of cognition, which I possess, and that of election or the power of free choice,—in other words, the understanding and the will. For by the understanding alone, I neither affirm nor deny anything but merely apprehend (percipio) the ideas regarding which I may form a judgment; nor is any error, properly so called, found in it thus accurately taken. And although there are perhaps innumerable objects in the world of which I have no idea in my understanding, it cannot, on that account be said that I am deprived of those ideas as of something that is due to my nature, but simply that I do not possess them, because, in truth, there is no ground to prove that Deity ought to have endowed me with a larger faculty of cognition than he has actually bestowed upon me; and however skillful a workman I suppose him to be, I have no reason, on that account, to think that it was obligatory on him to give to each of his works all the perfections he is able to bestow upon some. Nor, moreover, can I complain that God has not given me freedom of choice, or a will sufficiently ample and perfect, since, in truth, I am conscious of will so ample and extended as to be superior to all limits. And what appears to me here to be highly remarkable is that, of all the other properties I possess, there is none so great and perfect as that I do not clearly discern it could be still greater and more perfect. For, to take an example, if I consider the faculty of understanding which I possess, I find that it is of very small extent, and greatly limited, and at the same time I form the idea of another faculty of the same nature, much more ample and even infinite, and seeing that I can frame the idea of it, I discover, from this circumstance alone, that it pertains to the nature of God. In the same way, if I examine the faculty of memory or imagination, or any other faculty I possess, I find none that is not small and circumscribed, and in God immense and infinite. It is the faculty of will only, or freedom of choice, which I experience to be so great that I am unable to conceive the idea of another that shall be more ample and extended; so that it is chiefly my will which leads me to discern that I bear a certain image and similitude of Deity. For although the faculty of will is incomparably greater in God than in myself, as well in respect of the knowledge and power that are conjoined with it, and that render it stronger and more efficacious, as in respect of the object, since in him it extends to a greater number of things, it does not, nevertheless, appear to me greater, considered in itself formally and precisely: for the power of will consists only in this, that we are able to do or not to do the same thing (that is, to affirm or deny, to pursue or shun it), or rather in this alone, that in affirming or denying, pursuing or shunning, what is proposed to us by the understanding, we so act that we are not conscious of being determined to a particular action by any external force. For, to the possession of freedom, it is not necessary that I be alike indifferent toward each of two contraries; but, on the contrary, the more I am inclined toward the one, whether because I clearly know that in it there is the reason of truth and goodness, or because God thus internally disposes my thought, the more freely do I choose and embrace it; and assuredly divine grace and natural knowledge, very far from diminishing liberty, rather augment and fortify it. But the indifference of which I am conscious when I am not impelled to one side rather than to another for want of a reason, is the lowest grade of liberty, and manifests defect or negation of knowledge rather than perfection of will; for if I always clearly knew what was true and good, I should never have any difficulty in determining what judgment I ought to come to, and what choice I ought to make, and I should thus be entirely free without ever being indifferent.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iv.php,Descartes,Meditation Four
"9. From all this I discover, however, that neither the power of willing, which I have received from God, is of itself the source of my errors, for it is exceedingly ample and perfect in its kind; nor even the power of understanding, for as I conceive no object unless by means of the faculty that God bestowed upon me, all that I conceive is doubtless rightly conceived by me, and it is impossible for me to be deceived in it. Whence, then, spring my errors? They arise from this cause alone, that I do not restrain the will, which is of much wider range than the understanding, within the same limits, but extend it even to things I do not understand, and as the will is of itself indifferent to such, it readily falls into error and sin by choosing the false in room of the true, and evil instead of good.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iv.php,Descartes,Meditation Four
"10. For example, when I lately considered whether aught really existed in the world, and found that because I considered this question, it very manifestly followed that I myself existed, I could not but judge that what I so clearly conceived was true, not that I was forced to this judgment by any external cause, but simply because great clearness of the understanding was succeeded by strong inclination in the will; and I believed this the more freely and spontaneously in proportion as I was less indifferent with respect to it. But now I not only know that I exist, in so far as I am a thinking being, but there is likewise presented to my mind a certain idea of corporeal nature; hence I am in doubt as to whether the thinking nature which is in me, or rather which I myself am, is different from that corporeal nature, or whether both are merely one and the same thing, and I here suppose that I am as yet ignorant of any reason that would determine me to adopt the one belief in preference to the other; whence it happens that it is a matter of perfect indifference to me which of the two suppositions I affirm or deny, or whether I form any judgment at all in the matter.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iv.php,Descartes,Meditation Four
"11. This indifference, moreover, extends not only to things of which the understanding has no knowledge at all, but in general also to all those which it does not discover with perfect clearness at the moment the will is deliberating upon them; for, however probable the conjectures may be that dispose me to form a judgment in a particular matter, the simple knowledge that these are merely conjectures, and not certain and indubitable reasons, is sufficient to lead me to form one that is directly the opposite. Of this I lately had abundant experience, when I laid aside as false all that I had before held for true, on the single ground that I could in some degree doubt of it.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iv.php,Descartes,Meditation Four
"12. But if I abstain from judging of a thing when I do not conceive it with sufficient clearness and distinctness, it is plain that I act rightly, and am not deceived; but if I resolve to deny or affirm, I then do not make a right use of my free will; and if I affirm what is false, it is evident that I am deceived; moreover, even although I judge according to truth, I stumble upon it by chance, and do not therefore escape the imputation of a wrong use of my freedom; for it is a dictate of the natural light, that the knowledge of the understanding ought always to precede the determination of the will. And it is this wrong use of the freedom of the will in which is found the privation that constitutes the form of error. Privation, I say, is found in the act, in so far as it proceeds from myself, but it does not exist in the faculty which I received from God, nor even in the act, in so far as it depends on him",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iv.php,Descartes,Meditation Four
"13. For I have assuredly no reason to complain that God has not given me a greater power of intelligence or more perfect natural light than he has actually bestowed, since it is of the nature of a finite understanding not to comprehend many things, and of the nature of a created understanding to be finite; on the contrary, I have every reason to render thanks to God, who owed me nothing, for having given me all the perfections I possess, and I should be far from thinking that he has unjustly deprived me of, or kept back, the other perfections which he has not bestowed upon me.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iv.php,Descartes,Meditation Four
"14. I have no reason, moreover, to complain because he has given me a will more ample than my understanding, since, as the will consists only of a single element, and that indivisible, it would appear that this faculty is of such a nature that nothing could be taken from it without destroying it; and certainly, the more extensive it is, the more cause I have to thank the goodness of him who bestowed it upon me",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iv.php,Descartes,Meditation Four
"15. And, finally, I ought not also to complain that God concurs with me in forming the acts of this will, or the judgments in which I am deceived, because those acts are wholly true and good, in so far as they depend on God; and the ability to form them is a higher degree of perfection in my nature than the want of it would be. With regard to privation, in which alone consists the formal reason of error and sin, this does not require the concurrence of Deity, because it is not a thing or existence, and if it be referred to God as to its cause, it ought not to be called privation, but negation according to the signification of these words in the schools. For in truth it is no imperfection in Deity that he has accorded to me the power of giving or withholding my assent from certain things of which he has not put a clear and distinct knowledge in my understanding; but it is doubtless an imperfection in me that I do not use my freedom aright, and readily give my judgment on matters which I only obscurely and confusedly conceive. I perceive, nevertheless, that it was easy for Deity so to have constituted me as that I should never be deceived, although I still remained free and possessed of a limited knowledge, viz., by implanting in my understanding a clear and distinct knowledge of all the objects respecting which I should ever have to deliberate; or simply by so deeply engraving on my memory the resolution to judge of nothing without previously possessing a clear and distinct conception of it, that I should never forget it. And I easily understand that, in so far as I consider myself as a single whole, without reference to any other being in the universe, I should have been much more perfect than I now am, had Deity created me superior to error; but I cannot therefore deny that it is not somehow a greater perfection in the universe, that certain of its parts are not exempt from defect, as others are, than if they were all perfectly alike. And I have no right to complain because God, who placed me in the world, was not willing that I should sustain that character which of all others is the chief and most perfect.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iv.php,Descartes,Meditation Four
"16. I have even good reason to remain satisfied on the ground that, if he has not given me the perfection of being superior to error by the first means I have pointed out above, which depends on a clear and evident knowledge of all the matters regarding which I can deliberate, he has at least left in my power the other means, which is, firmly to retain the resolution never to judge where the truth is not clearly known to me: for, although I am conscious of the weakness of not being able to keep my mind continually fixed on the same thought, I can nevertheless, by attentive and oft-repeated meditation, impress it so strongly on my memory that I shall never fail to recollect it as often as I require it, and I can acquire in this way the habitude of not erring.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iv.php,Descartes,Meditation Four
"17. And since it is in being superior to error that the highest and chief perfection of man consists, I deem that I have not gained little by this day's meditation, in having discovered the source of error and falsity. And certainly this can be no other than what I have now explained: for as often as I so restrain my will within the limits of my knowledge, that it forms no judgment except regarding objects which are clearly and distinctly represented to it by the understanding, I can never be deceived; because every clear and distinct conception is doubtless something, and as such cannot owe its origin to nothing, but must of necessity have God for its author— God, I say, who, as supremely perfect, cannot, without a contradiction, be the cause of any error; and consequently it is necessary to conclude that every such conception or judgment is true. Nor have I merely learned to-day what I must avoid to escape error, but also what I must do to arrive at the knowledge of truth; for I will assuredly reach truth if I only fix my attention sufficiently on all the things I conceive perfectly, and separate these from others which I conceive more confusedly and obscurely; to which for the future I shall give diligent heed.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/iv.php,Descartes,Meditation Four
"1. Several other questions remain for consideration respecting the attributes of God and my own nature or mind. I will, however, on some other occasion perhaps resume the investigation of these. Meanwhile, as I have discovered what must be done and what avoided to arrive at the knowledge of truth, what I have chiefly to do is to essay to emerge from the state of doubt in which I have for some time been, and to discover whether anything can be known with certainty regarding material objects.",No,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/v.php,Descartes,Meditation Five
"2. But before considering whether such objects as I conceive exist without me, I must examine their ideas in so far as these are to be found in my consciousness, and discover which of them are distinct and which confused.",No,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/v.php,Descartes,Meditation Five
"3. In the first place, I distinctly imagine that quantity which the philosophers commonly call continuous, or the extension in length, breadth, and depth that is in this quantity, or rather in the object to which it is attributed. Further, I can enumerate in it many diverse parts, and attribute to each of these all sorts of sizes, figures, situations, and local motions; and, in fine, I can assign to each of these motions all degrees of duration",No,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/v.php,Descartes,Meditation Five
"4. And I not only distinctly know these things when I thus consider them in general; but besides, by a little attention, I discover innumerable particulars respecting figures, numbers, motion, and the like, which are so evidently true, and so accordant with my nature, that when I now discover them I do not so much appear to learn anything new, as to call to remembrance what I before knew, or for the first time to remark what was before in my mind, but to which I had not hitherto directed my attention.",No,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/v.php,Descartes,Meditation Five
"5. And what I here find of most importance is, that I discover in my mind innumerable ideas of certain objects, which cannot be esteemed pure negations, although perhaps they possess no reality beyond my thought, and which are not framed by me though it may be in my power to think, or not to think them, but possess true and immutable natures of their own. As, for example, when I imagine a triangle, although there is not perhaps and never was in any place in the universe apart from my thought one such figure, it remains true nevertheless that this figure possesses a certain determinate nature, form, or essence, which is immutable and eternal, and not framed by me, nor in any degree dependent on my thought; as appears from the circumstance, that diverse properties of the triangle may be demonstrated, viz, that its three angles are equal to two right, that its greatest side is subtended by its greatest angle, and the like, which, whether I will or not, I now clearly discern to belong to it, although before I did not at all think of them, when, for the first time, I imagined a triangle, and which accordingly cannot be said to have been invented by me.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/v.php,Descartes,Meditation Five
"6. Nor is it a valid objection to allege, that perhaps this idea of a triangle came into my mind by the medium of the senses, through my having. seen bodies of a triangular figure; for I am able to form in thought an innumerable variety of figures with regard to which it cannot be supposed that they were ever objects of sense, and I can nevertheless demonstrate diverse properties of their nature no less than of the triangle, all of which are assuredly true since I clearly conceive them: and they are therefore something, and not mere negations; for it is highly evident that all that is true is something, truth being identical with existence; and I have already fully shown the truth of the principle, that whatever is clearly and distinctly known is true. And although this had not been demonstrated, yet the nature of my mind is such as to compel me to assert to what I clearly conceive while I so conceive it; and I recollect that even when I still strongly adhered to the objects of sense, I reckoned among the number of the most certain truths those I clearly conceived relating to figures, numbers, and other matters that pertain to arithmetic and geometry, and in general to the pure mathematics.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/v.php,Descartes,Meditation Five
"7. But now if because I can draw from my thought the idea of an object, it follows that all I clearly and distinctly apprehend to pertain to this object, does in truth belong to it, may I not from this derive an argument for the existence of God? It is certain that I no less find the idea of a God in my consciousness, that is the idea of a being supremely perfect, than that of any figure or number whatever: and I know with not less clearness and distinctness that an actual and eternal existence pertains to his nature than that all which is demonstrable of any figure or number really belongs to the nature of that figure or number; and, therefore, although all the conclusions of the preceding Meditations were false, the existence of God would pass with me for a truth at least as certain as I ever judged any truth of mathematics to be.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/v.php,Descartes,Meditation Five
"8. Indeed such a doctrine may at first sight appear to contain more sophistry than truth. For, as I have been accustomed in every other matter to distinguish between existence and essence, I easily believe that the existence can be separated from the essence of God, and that thus God may be conceived as not actually existing. But, nevertheless, when I think of it more attentively, it appears that the existence can no more be separated from the essence of God, than the idea of a mountain from that of a valley, or the equality of its three angles to two right angles, from the essence of a rectilinear triangle; so that it is not less impossible to conceive a God, that is, a being supremely perfect, to whom existence is awanting, or who is devoid of a certain perfection, than to conceive a mountain without a valley.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/v.php,Descartes,Meditation Five
"9. But though, in truth, I cannot conceive a God unless as existing, any more than I can a mountain without a valley, yet, just as it does not follow that there is any mountain in the world merely because I conceive a mountain with a valley, so likewise, though I conceive God as existing, it does not seem to follow on that account that God exists; for my thought imposes no necessity on things; and as I may imagine a winged horse, though there be none such, so I could perhaps attribute existence to God, though no God existed.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/v.php,Descartes,Meditation Five
"10. But the cases are not analogous, and a fallacy lurks under the semblance of this objection: for because I cannot conceive a mountain without a valley, it does not follow that there is any mountain or valley in existence, but simply that the mountain or valley, whether they do or do not exist, are inseparable from each other; whereas, on the other hand, because I cannot conceive God unless as existing, it follows that existence is inseparable from him, and therefore that he really exists: not that this is brought about by my thought, or that it imposes any necessity on things, but, on the contrary, the necessity which lies in the thing itself, that is, the necessity of the existence of God, determines me to think in this way: for it is not in my power to conceive a God without existence, that is, a being supremely perfect, and yet devoid of an absolute perfection, as I am free to imagine a horse with or without wings.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/v.php,Descartes,Meditation Five
"11. Nor must it be alleged here as an objection, that it is in truth necessary to admit that God exists, after having supposed him to possess all perfections, since existence is one of them, but that my original supposition was not necessary; just as it is not necessary to think that all quadrilateral figures can be inscribed in the circle, since, if I supposed this, I should be constrained to admit that the rhombus, being a figure of four sides, can be therein inscribed, which, however, is manifestly false. This objection is, I say, incompetent; for although it may not be necessary that I shall at any time entertain the notion of Deity, yet each time I happen to think of a first and sovereign being, and to draw, so to speak, the idea of him from the storehouse of the mind, I am necessitated to attribute to him all kinds of perfections, though I may not then enumerate them all, nor think of each of them in particular. And this necessity is sufficient, as soon as I discover that existence is a perfection, to cause me to infer the existence of this first and sovereign being; just as it is not necessary that I should ever imagine any triangle, but whenever I am desirous of considering a rectilinear figure composed of only three angles, it is absolutely necessary to attribute those properties to it from which it is correctly inferred that its three angles are not greater than two right angles, although perhaps I may not then advert to this relation in particular. But when I consider what figures are capable of being inscribed in the circle, it is by no means necessary to hold that all quadrilateral figures are of this number; on the contrary, I cannot even imagine such to be the case, so long as I shall be unwilling to accept in thought aught that I do not clearly and distinctly conceive; and consequently there is a vast difference between false suppositions, as is the one in question, and the true ideas that were born with me, the first and chief of which is the idea of God. For indeed I discern on many grounds that this idea is not factitious depending simply on my thought, but that it is the representation of a true and immutable nature: in the first place because I can conceive no other being, except God, to whose essence existence necessarily pertains; in the second, because it is impossible to conceive two or more gods of this kind; and it being supposed that one such God exists, I clearly see that he must have existed from all eternity, and will exist to all eternity; and finally, because I apprehend many other properties in God, none of which I can either diminish or change.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/v.php,Descartes,Meditation Five
"12. But, indeed, whatever mode of probation I in the end adopt, it always returns to this, that it is only the things I clearly and distinctly conceive which have the power of completely persuading me. And although, of the objects I conceive in this manner, some, indeed, are obvious to every one, while others are only discovered after close and careful investigation; nevertheless after they are once discovered, the latter are not esteemed less certain than the former. Thus, for example, to take the case of a right-angled triangle, although it is not so manifest at first that the square of the base is equal to the squares of the other two sides, as that the base is opposite to the greatest angle; nevertheless, after it is once apprehended, we are as firmly persuaded of the truth of the former as of the latter. And, with respect to God if I were not pre-occupied by prejudices, and my thought beset on all sides by the continual presence of the images of sensible objects, I should know nothing sooner or more easily then the fact of his being. For is there any truth more clear than the existence of a Supreme Being, or of God, seeing it is to his essence alone that necessary and eterna existence pertains?",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/v.php,Descartes,Meditation Five
"13. And although the right conception of this truth has cost me much close thinking, nevertheless at present I feel not only as assured of it as of what I deem most certain, but I remark further that the certitude of all other truths is so absolutely dependent on it that without this knowledge it is impossible ever to know anything perfectly.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/v.php,Descartes,Meditation Five
"14. For although I am of such a nature as to be unable, while I possess a very clear and distinct apprehension of a matter, to resist the conviction of its truth, yet because my constitution is also such as to incapacitate me from keeping my mind continually fixed on the same object, and as I frequently recollect a past judgment without at the same time being able to recall the grounds of it, it may happen meanwhile that other reasons are presented to me which would readily cause me to change my opinion, if I did not know that God existed; and thus I should possess no true and certain knowledge, but merely vague and vacillating opinions. Thus, for example, when I consider the nature of the rectilinear triangle, it most clearly appears to me, who have been instructed in the principles of geometry, that its three angles are equal to two right angles, and I find it impossible to believe otherwise, while I apply my mind to the demonstration; but as soon as I cease from attending to the process of proof, although I still remember that I had a clear comprehension of it, yet I may readily come to doubt of the truth demonstrated, if I do not know that there is a God: for I may persuade myself that I have been so constituted by nature as to be sometimes deceived, even in matters which I think I apprehend with the greatest evidence and certitude, especially when I recollect that I frequently considered many things to be true and certain which other reasons afterward constrained me to reckon as wholly false.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/v.php,Descartes,Meditation Five
"15. But after I have discovered that God exists, seeing I also at the same time observed that all things depend on him, and that he is no deceiver, and thence inferred that all which I clearly and distinctly perceive is of necessity true: although I no longer attend to the grounds of a judgment, no opposite reason can be alleged sufficient to lead me to doubt of its truth, provided only I remember that I once possessed a clear and distinct comprehension of it. My knowledge of it thus becomes true and certain. And this same knowledge extends likewise to whatever I remember to have formerly demonstrated, as the truths of geometry and the like: for what can be alleged against them to lead me to doubt of them? Will it be that my nature is such that I may be frequently deceived? But I already know that I cannot be deceived in judgments of the grounds of which I possess a clear knowledge. Will it be that I formerly deemed things to be true and certain which I afterward discovered to be false? But I had no clear and distinct knowledge of any of those things, and, being as yet ignorant of the rule by which I am assured of the truth of a judgment, I was led to give my assent to them on grounds which I afterward discovered were less strong than at the time I imagined them to be. What further objection, then, is there? Will it be said that perhaps I am dreaming (an objection I lately myself raised), or that all the thoughts of which I am now conscious have no more truth than the reveries of my dreams? But although, in truth, I should be dreaming, the rule still holds that all which is clearly presented to my intellect is indisputably true. 16. And thus I very clearly see that the certitude and truth of all science depends on the knowledge alone of the true God, insomuch that, before I knew him, I could have no perfect knowledge of any other thing. And now that I know him, I possess the means of acquiring a perfect knowledge respecting innumerable matters, as well relative to God himself and other intellectual objects as to corporeal nature, in so far as it is the object of pure mathematics which do not consider whether it exists or not.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/v.php,Descartes,Meditation Five
"1. There now only remains the inquiry as to whether material things exist. With regard to this question, I at least know with certainty that such things may exist, in as far as they constitute the object of the pure mathematics, since, regarding them in this aspect, I can conceive them clearly and distinctly. For there can be no doubt that God possesses the power of producing all the objects I am able distinctly to conceive, and I never considered anything impossible to him, unless when I experienced a contradiction in the attempt to conceive it aright. Further, the faculty of imagination which I possess, and of which I am conscious that I make use when I apply myself to the consideration of material things, is sufficient to persuade me of their existence: for, when I attentively consider what imagination is, I find that it is simply a certain application of the cognitive faculty ( facultas cognoscitiva) to a body which is immediately present to it, and which therefore exists.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six
"2. And to render this quite clear, I remark, in the first place, the difference that subsists between imagination and pure intellection or conception . For example, when I imagine a triangle I not only conceive (intelligo) that it is a figure comprehended by three lines, but at the same time also I look upon (intueor) these three lines as present by the power and internal application of my mind (acie mentis), and this is what I call imagining. But if I desire to think of a chiliogon, I indeed rightly conceive that it is a figure composed of a thousand sides, as easily as I conceive that a triangle is a figure composed of only three sides; but I cannot imagine the thousand sides of a chiliogon as I do the three sides of a triangle, nor, so to speak, view them as present with the eyes of my mind . And although, in accordance with the habit I have of always imagining something when I think of corporeal things, it may happen that, in conceiving a chiliogon, I confusedly represent some figure to myself, yet it is quite evident that this is not a chiliogon, since it in no wise differs from that which I would represent to myself, if I were to think of a myriogon, or any other figure of many sides; nor would this representation be of any use in discovering and unfolding the properties that constitute the difference between a chiliogon and other polygons. But if the question turns on a pentagon, it is quite true that I can conceive its figure, as well as that of a chiliogon, without the aid of imagination; but I can likewise imagine it by applying the attention of my mind to its five sides, and at the same time to the area which they contain. Thus I observe that a special effort of mind is necessary to the act of imagination, which is not required to conceiving or understanding (ad intelligendum); and this special exertion of mind clearly shows the difference between imagination and pure intellection (imaginatio et intellectio pura).",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six
"3. I remark, besides, that this power of imagination which I possess, in as far as it differs from the power of conceiving, is in no way necessary to my nature or essence, that is, to the essence of my mind; for although I did not possess it, I should still remain the same that I now am, from which it seems we may conclude that it depends on something different from the mind. And I easily understand that, if some body exists, with which my mind is so conjoined and united as to be able, as it were, to consider it when it chooses, it may thus imagine corporeal objects; so that this mode of thinking differs from pure intellection only in this respect, that the mind in conceiving turns in some way upon itself, and considers some one of the ideas it possesses within itself; but in imagining it turns toward the body, and contemplates in it some object conformed to the idea which it either of itself conceived or apprehended by sense. I easily understand, I say, that imagination may be thus formed, if it is true that there are bodies; and because I find no other obvious mode of explaining it, I thence, with probability, conjecture that they exist, but only with probability; and although I carefully examine all things, nevertheless I do not find that, from the distinct idea of corporeal nature I have in my imagination, I can necessarily infer the existence of any body.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six
"4. But I am accustomed to imagine many other objects besides that corporeal nature which is the object of the pure mathematics, as, for example, colors, sounds, tastes, pain, and the like, although with less distinctness; and, inasmuch as I perceive these objects much better by the senses, through the medium of which and of memory, they seem to have reached the imagination, I believe that, in order the more advantageously to examine them, it is proper I should at the same time examine what sense-perception is, and inquire whether from those ideas that are apprehended by this mode of thinking ( consciousness), I cannot obtain a certain proof of the existence of corporeal objects.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six
"5. And, in the first place, I will recall to my mind the things I have hitherto held as true, because perceived by the senses, and the foundations upon which my belief in their truth rested; I will, in the second place, examine the reasons that afterward constrained me to doubt of them; and, finally, I will consider what of them I ought now to believe.",No,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six
"6. Firstly, then, I perceived that I had a head, hands, feet and other members composing that body which I considered as part, or perhaps even as the whole, of myself. I perceived further, that that body was placed among many others, by which it was capable of being affected in diverse ways, both beneficial and hurtful; and what was beneficial I remarked by a certain sensation of pleasure, and what was hurtful by a sensation of pain. And besides this pleasure and pain, I was likewise conscious of hunger, thirst, and other appetites, as well as certain corporeal inclinations toward joy, sadness, anger, and similar passions. And, out of myself, besides the extension, figure, and motions of bodies, I likewise perceived in them hardness, heat, and the other tactile qualities, and, in addition, light, colors, odors, tastes, and sounds, the variety of which gave me the means of distinguishing the sky, the earth, the sea, and generally all the other bodies, from one another. And certainly, considering the ideas of all these qualities, which were presented to my mind, and which alone I properly and immediately perceived, it was not without reason that I thought I perceived certain objects wholly different from my thought, namely, bodies from which those ideas proceeded; for I was conscious that the ideas were presented to me without my consent being required, so that I could not perceive any object, however desirous I might be, unless it were present to the organ of sense; and it was wholly out of my power not to perceive it when it was thus present. And because the ideas I perceived by the senses were much more lively and clear, and even, in their own way, more distinct than any of those I could of myself frame by meditation, or which I found impressed on my memory, it seemed that they could not have proceeded from myself, and must therefore have been caused in me by some other objects; and as of those objects I had no knowledge beyond what the ideas themselves gave me, nothing was so likely to occur to my mind as the supposition that the objects were similar to the ideas which they caused. And because I recollected also that I had formerly trusted to the senses, rather than to reason, and that the ideas which I myself formed were not so clear as those I perceived by sense, and that they were even for the most part composed of parts of the latter, I was readily persuaded that I had no idea in my intellect which had not formerly passed through the senses. Nor was I altogether wrong in likewise believing that that body which, by a special right, I called my own, pertained to me more properly and strictly than any of the others; for in truth, I could never be separated from it as from other bodies; I felt in it and on account of it all my appetites and affections, and in fine I was affected in its parts by pain and the titillation of pleasure, and not in the parts of the other bodies that were separated from it. But when I inquired into the reason why, from this I know not what sensation of pain, sadness of mind should follow, and why from the sensation of pleasure, joy should arise, or why this indescribable twitching of the stomach, which I call hunger, should put me in mind of taking food, and the parchedness of the throat of drink, and so in other cases, I was unable to give any explanation, unless that I was so taught by nature; for there is assuredly no affinity, at least none that I am able to comprehend, between this irritation of the stomach and the desire of food, any more than between the perception of an object that causes pain and the consciousness of sadness which springs from the perception. And in the same way it seemed to me that all the other judgments I had formed regarding the objects of sense, were dictates of nature; because I remarked that those judgments were formed in me, before I had leisure to weigh and consider the reasons that might constrain me to form them.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six
"7. But, afterward, a wide experience by degrees sapped the faith I had reposed in my senses; for I frequently observed that towers, which at a distance seemed round, appeared square, when more closely viewed, and that colossal figures, raised on the summits of these towers, looked like small statues, when viewed from the bottom of them; and, in other instances without number, I also discovered error in judgments founded on the external senses; and not only in those founded on the external, but even in those that rested on the internal senses; for is there aught more internal than pain? And yet I have sometimes been informed by parties whose arm or leg had been amputated, that they still occasionally seemed to feel pain in that part of the body which they had lost, —a circumstance that led me to think that I could not be quite certain even that any one of my members was affected when I felt pain in it. And to these grounds of doubt I shortly afterward also added two others of very wide generality: the first of them was that I believed I never perceived anything when awake which I could not occasionally think I also perceived when asleep, and as I do not believe that the ideas I seem to perceive in my sleep proceed from objects external to me, I did not any more observe any ground for believing this of such as I seem to perceive when awake; the second was that since I was as yet ignorant of the author of my being or at least supposed myself to be so, I saw nothing to prevent my having been so constituted by nature as that I should be deceived even in matters that appeared to me to possess the greatest truth. And, with respect to the grounds on which I had before been persuaded of the existence of sensible objects, I had no great difficulty in finding suitable answers to them; for as nature seemed to incline me to many things from which reason made me averse, I thought that I ought not to confide much in its teachings. And although the perceptions of the senses were not dependent on my will, I did not think that I ought on that ground to conclude that they proceeded from things different from myself, since perhaps there might be found in me some faculty, though hitherto unknown to me, which produced them.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six
"8. But now that I begin to know myself better, and to discover more clearly the author of my being, I do not, indeed, think that I ought rashly to admit all which the senses seem to teach, nor, on the other hand, is it my conviction that I ought to doubt in general of their teachings.",No,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six
"9. And, firstly, because I know that all which I clearly and distinctly conceive can be produced by God exactly as I conceive it, it is sufficient that I am able clearly and distinctly to conceive one thing apart from another, in order to be certain that the one is different from the other, seeing they may at least be made to exist separately, by the omnipotence of God; and it matters not by what power this separation is made, in order to be compelled to judge them different; and, therefore, merely because I know with certitude that I exist, and because, in the meantime, I do not observe that aught necessarily belongs to my nature or essence beyond my being a thinking thing, I rightly conclude that my essence consists only in my being a thinking thing or a substance whose whole essence or nature is merely thinking. And although I may, or rather, as I will shortly say, although I certainly do possess a body with which I am very closely conjoined; nevertheless, because, on the one hand, I have a clear and distinct idea of myself, in as far as I am only a thinking and unextended thing, and as, on the other hand, I possess a distinct idea of body, in as far as it is only an extended and unthinking thing, it is certain that I, that is, my mind, by which I am what I am, is entirely and truly distinct from my body, and may exist without it.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six
"10. Moreover, I find in myself diverse faculties of thinking that have each their special mode: for example, I find I possess the faculties of imagining and perceiving, without which I can indeed clearly and distinctly conceive myself as entire, but I cannot reciprocally conceive them without conceiving myself, that is to say, without an intelligent substance in which they reside, for in the notion we have of them, or to use the terms of the schools in their formal concept, they comprise some sort of intellection; whence I perceive that they are distinct from myself as modes are from things. I remark likewise certain other faculties, as the power of changing place, of assuming diverse figures, and the like, that cannot be conceived and cannot therefore exist, any more than the preceding, apart from a substance in which they inhere. It is very evident, however, that these faculties, if they really exist, must belong to some corporeal or extended substance, since in their clear and distinct concept there is contained some sort of extension, but no intellection at all. Further, I cannot doubt but that there is in me a certain passive faculty of perception, that is, of receiving and taking knowledge of the ideas of sensible things; but this would be useless to me, if there did not also exist in me, or in some other thing, another active faculty capable of forming and producing those ideas. But this active faculty cannot be in me in as far as I am but a thinking thing, seeing that it does not presuppose thought, and also that those ideas are frequently produced in my mind without my contributing to it in any way, and even frequently contrary to my will. This faculty must therefore exist in some substance different from me, in which all the objective reality of the ideas that are produced by this faculty is contained formally or eminently, as I before remarked; and this substance is either a body, that is to say, a corporeal nature in which is contained formally and in effect all that is objectively and by representation in those ideas; or it is God himself, or some other creature, of a rank superior to body, in which the same is contained eminently. But as God is no deceiver, it is manifest that he does not of himself and immediately communicate those ideas to me, nor even by the intervention of any creature in which their objective reality is not formally, but only eminently, contained. For as he has given me no faculty whereby I can discover this to be the case, but, on the contrary, a very strong inclination to believe that those ideas arise from corporeal objects, I do not see how he could be vindicated from the charge of deceit, if in truth they proceeded from any other source, or were produced by other causes than corporeal things: and accordingly it must be concluded, that corporeal objects exist. Nevertheless, they are not perhaps exactly such as we perceive by the senses, for their comprehension by the senses is, in many instances, very obscure and confused; but it is at least necessary to admit that all which I clearly and distinctly conceive as in them, that is, generally speaking all that is comprehended in the object of speculative geometry, really exists external to me.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six
"11. But with respect to other things which are either only particular, as, for example, that the sun is of such a size and figure, etc., or are conceived with less clearness and distinctness, as light, sound, pain, and the like, although they are highly dubious and uncertain, nevertheless on the ground alone that God is no deceiver, and that consequently he has permitted no falsity in my opinions which he has not likewise given me a faculty of correcting, I think I may with safety conclude that I possess in myself the means of arriving at the truth. And, in the first place, it cannot be doubted that in each of the dictates of nature there is some truth: for by nature, considered in general, I now understand nothing more than God himself, or the order and disposition established by God in created things; and by my nature in particular I understand the assemblage of all that God has given me.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six
"12. But there is nothing which that nature teaches me more expressly or more sensibly than that I have a body which is ill affected when I feel pain, and stands in need of food and drink when I experience the sensations of hunger and thirst, etc. And therefore I ought not to doubt but that there is some truth in these informations.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six
"13. Nature likewise teaches me by these sensations of pain, hunger, thirst, etc., that I am not only lodged in my body as a pilot in a vessel, but that I am besides so intimately conjoined, and as it were intermixed with it, that my mind and body compose a certain unity. For if this were not the case, I should not feel pain when my body is hurt, seeing I am merely a thinking thing, but should perceive the wound by the understanding alone, just as a pilot perceives by sight when any part of his vessel is damaged; and when my body has need of food or drink, I should have a clear knowledge of this, and not be made aware of it by the confused sensations of hunger and thirst: for, in truth, all these sensations of hunger, thirst, pain, etc., are nothing more than certain confused modes of thinking, arising from the union and apparent fusion of mind and body.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six
"14. Besides this, nature teaches me that my own body is surrounded by many other bodies, some of which I have to seek after, and others to shun. And indeed, as I perceive different sorts of colors, sounds, odors, tastes, heat, hardness, etc., I safely conclude that there are in the bodies from which the diverse perceptions of the senses proceed, certain varieties corresponding to them, although, perhaps, not in reality like them; and since, among these diverse perceptions of the senses, some are agreeable, and others disagreeable, there can be no doubt that my body, or rather my entire self, in as far as I am composed of body and mind, may be variously affected, both beneficially and hurtfully, by surrounding bodies.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six
"15. But there are many other beliefs which though seemingly the teaching of nature, are not in reality so, but which obtained a place in my mind through a habit of judging inconsiderately of things. It may thus easily happen that such judgments shall contain error: thus, for example, the opinion I have that all space in which there is nothing to affect or make an impression on my senses is void: that in a hot body there is something in every respect similar to the idea of heat in my mind; that in a white or green body there is the same whiteness or greenness which I perceive; that in a bitter or sweet body there is the same taste, and so in other instances; that the stars, towers, and all distant bodies, are of the same size and figure as they appear to our eyes, etc. But that I may avoid everything like indistinctness of conception, I must accurately define what I properly understand by being taught by nature. For nature is here taken in a narrower sense than when it signifies the sum of all the things which God has given me; seeing that in that meaning the notion comprehends much that belongs only to the mind to which I am not here to be understood as referring when I use the term nature; as, for example, the notion I have of the truth, that what is done cannot be undone, and all the other truths I discern by the natural light without the aid of the body; and seeing that it comprehends likewise much besides that belongs only to body, and is not here any more contained under the name nature, as the quality of heaviness, and the like, of which I do not speak, the term being reserved exclusively to designate the things which God has given to me as a being composed of mind and body. But nature, taking the term in the sense explained, teaches me to shun what causes in me the sensation of pain, and to pursue what affords me the sensation of pleasure, and other things of this sort; but I do not discover that it teaches me, in addition to this, from these diverse perceptions of the senses, to draw any conclusions respecting external objects without a previous careful and mature consideration of them by the mind: for it is, as appears to me, the office of the mind alone, and not of the composite whole of mind and body, to discern the truth in those matters. Thus, although the impression a star makes on my eye is not larger than that from the flame of a candle, I do not, nevertheless, experience any real or positive impulse determining me to believe that the star is not greater than the flame; the true account of the matter being merely that I have so judged from my youth without any rational ground. And, though on approaching the fire I feel heat, and even pain on approaching it too closely, I have, however, from this no ground for holding that something resembling the heat I feel is in the fire, any more than that there is something similar to the pain; all that I have ground for believing is, that there is something in it, whatever it may be, which excites in me those sensations of heat or pain. So also, although there are spaces in which I find nothing to excite and affect my senses, I must not therefore conclude that those spaces contain in them no body; for I see that in this, as in many other similar matters, I have been accustomed to pervert the order of nature, because these perceptions of the senses, although given me by nature merely to signify to my mind what things are beneficial and hurtful to the composite whole of which it is a part, and being sufficiently clear and distinct for that purpose, are nevertheless used by me as infallible rules by which to determine immediately the essence of the bodies that exist out of me, of which they can of course afford me only the most obscure and confused knowledge.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six
"16. But I have already sufficiently considered how it happens that, notwithstanding the supreme goodness of God, there is falsity in my judgments. A difficulty, however, here presents itself, respecting the things which I am taught by nature must be pursued or avoided, and also respecting the internal sensations in which I seem to have occasionally detected error, and thus to be directly deceived by nature: thus, for example, I may be so deceived by the agreeable taste of some viand with which poison has been mixed, as to be induced to take the poison. In this case, however, nature may be excused, for it simply leads me to desire the viand for its agreeable taste, and not the poison, which is unknown to it; and thus we can infer nothing from this circumstance beyond that our nature is not omniscient; at which there is assuredly no ground for surprise, since, man being of a finite nature, his knowledge must likewise be of a limited perfection.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six
"17. But we also not unfrequently err in that to which we are directly impelled by nature, as is the case with invalids who desire drink or food that would be hurtful to them. It will here, perhaps, be alleged that the reason why such persons are deceived is that their nature is corrupted; but this leaves the difficulty untouched, for a sick man is not less really the creature of God than a man who is in full health; and therefore it is as repugnant to the goodness of God that the nature of the former should be deceitful as it is for that of the latter to be so. And as a clock, composed of wheels and counter weights, observes not the less accurately all the laws of nature when it is ill made, and points out the hours incorrectly, than when it satisfies the desire of the maker in every respect; so likewise if the body of man be considered as a kind of machine, so made up and composed of bones, nerves, muscles, veins, blood, and skin, that although there were in it no mind, it would still exhibit the same motions which it at present manifests involuntarily, and therefore without the aid of the mind, and simply by the dispositions of its organs, I easily discern that it would also be as natural for such a body, supposing it dropsical, for example, to experience the parchedness of the throat that is usually accompanied in the mind by the sensation of thirst, and to be disposed by this parchedness to move its nerves and its other parts in the way required for drinking, and thus increase its malady and do itself harm, as it is natural for it, when it is not indisposed to be stimulated to drink for its good by a similar cause; and although looking to the use for which a clock was destined by its maker, I may say that it is deflected from its proper nature when it incorrectly indicates the hours, and on the same principle, considering the machine of the human body as having been formed by God for the sake of the motions which it usually manifests, although I may likewise have ground for thinking that it does not follow the order of its nature when the throat is parched and drink does not tend to its preservation, nevertheless I yet plainly discern that this latter acceptation of the term nature is very different from the other: for this is nothing more than a certain denomination, depending entirely on my thought, and hence called extrinsic, by which I compare a sick man and an imperfectly constructed clock with the idea I have of a man in good health and a well made clock; while by the other acceptation of nature is understood something which is truly found in things, and therefore possessed of some truth.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six
"18. But certainly, although in respect of a dropsical body, it is only by way of exterior denomination that we say its nature is corrupted, when, without requiring drink, the throat is parched; yet, in respect of the composite whole, that is, of the mind in its union with the body, it is not a pure denomination, but really an error of nature, for it to feel thirst when drink would be hurtful to it: and, accordingly, it still remains to be considered why it is that the goodness of God does not prevent the nature of man thus taken from being fallacious.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six
"19. To commence this examination accordingly, I here remark, in the first place, that there is a vast difference between mind and body, in respect that body, from its nature, is always divisible, and that mind is entirely indivisible. For in truth, when I consider the mind, that is, when I consider myself in so far only as I am a thinking thing, I can distinguish in myself no parts, but I very clearly discern that I am somewhat absolutely one and entire; and although the whole mind seems to be united to the whole body, yet, when a foot, an arm, or any other part is cut off, I am conscious that nothing has been taken from my mind; nor can the faculties of willing, perceiving, conceiving, etc., properly be called its parts, for it is the same mind that is exercised all entire in willing, in perceiving, and in conceiving, etc. But quite the opposite holds in corporeal or extended things; for I cannot imagine any one of them how small soever it may be, which I cannot easily sunder in thought, and which, therefore, I do not know to be divisible. This would be sufficient to teach me that the mind or soul of man is entirely different from the body, if I had not already been apprised of it on other grounds.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six
"20. I remark, in the next place, that the mind does not immediately receive the impression from all the parts of the body, but only from the brain, or perhaps even from one small part of it, viz, that in which the common sense (senses communis) is said to be, which as often as it is affected in the same way gives rise to the same perception in the mind, although meanwhile the other parts of the body may be diversely disposed, as is proved by innumerable experiments, which it is unnecessary here to enumerate.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six
"21. I remark, besides, that the nature of body is such that none of its parts can be moved by another part a little removed from the other, which cannot likewise be moved in the same way by any one of the parts that lie between those two, although the most remote part does not act at all. As, for example, in the cord A, B, C, D, which is in tension, if its last part D, be pulled, the first part A, will not be moved in a different way than it would be were one of the intermediate parts B or C to be pulled, and the last part D meanwhile to remain fixed. And in the same way, when I feel pain in the foot, the science of physics teaches me that this sensation is experienced by means of the nerves dispersed over the foot, which, extending like cords from it to the brain, when they are contracted in the foot, contract at the same time the inmost parts of the brain in which they have their origin, and excite in these parts a certain motion appointed by nature to cause in the mind a sensation of pain, as if existing in the foot; but as these nerves must pass through the tibia, the leg, the loins, the back, and neck, in order to reach the brain, it may happen that although their extremities in the foot are not affected, but only certain of their parts that pass through the loins or neck, the same movements, nevertheless, are excited in the brain by this motion as would have been caused there by a hurt received in the foot, and hence the mind will necessarily feel pain in the foot, just as if it had been hurt; and the same is true of all the other perceptions of our senses.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six
"22. I remark, finally, that as each of the movements that are made in the part of the brain by which the mind is immediately affected, impresses it with but a single sensation, the most likely supposition in the circumstances is, that this movement causes the mind to experience, among all the sensations which it is capable of impressing upon it; that one which is the best fitted, and generally the most useful for the preservation of the human body when it is in full health. But experience shows us that all the perceptions which nature has given us are of such a kind as I have mentioned; and accordingly, there is nothing found in them that does not manifest the power and goodness of God. Thus, for example, when the nerves of the foot are violently or more than usually shaken, the motion passing through the medulla of the spine to the innermost parts of the brain affords a sign to the mind on which it experiences a sensation, viz, of pain, as if it were in the foot, by which the mind is admonished and excited to do its utmost to remove the cause of it as dangerous and hurtful to the foot. It is true that God could have so constituted the nature of man as that the same motion in the brain would have informed the mind of something altogether different: the motion might, for example, have been the occasion on which the mind became conscious of itself, in so far as it is in the brain, or in so far as it is in some place intermediate between the foot and the brain, or, finally, the occasion on which it perceived some other object quite different, whatever that might be; but nothing of all this would have so well contributed to the preservation of the body as that which the mind actually feels. In the same way, when we stand in need of drink, there arises from this want a certain parchedness in the throat that moves its nerves, and by means of them the internal parts of the brain; and this movement affects the mind with the sensation of thirst, because there is nothing on that occasion which is more useful for us than to be made aware that we have need of drink for the preservation of our health; and so in other instances.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six
"23. Whence it is quite manifest that, notwithstanding the sovereign goodness of God, the nature of man, in so far as it is composed of mind and body, cannot but be sometimes fallacious. For, if there is any cause which excites, not in the foot, but in some one of the parts of the nerves that stretch from the foot to the brain, or even in the brain itself, the same movement that is ordinarily created when the foot is ill affected, pain will be felt, as it were, in the foot, and the sense will thus be naturally deceived; for as the same movement in the brain can but impress the mind with the same sensation, and as this sensation is much more frequently excited by a cause which hurts the foot than by one acting in a different quarter, it is reasonable that it should lead the mind to feel pain in the foot rather than in any other part of the body. And if it sometimes happens that the parchedness of the throat does not arise, as is usual, from drink being necessary for the health of the body, but from quite the opposite cause, as is the case with the dropsical, yet it is much better that it should be deceitful in that instance, than if, on the contrary, it were continually fallacious when the body is well-disposed; and the same holds true in other cases.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six
"24. And certainly this consideration is of great service, not only in enabling me to recognize the errors to which my nature is liable, but likewise in rendering it more easy to avoid or correct them: for, knowing that all my senses more usually indicate to me what is true than what is false, in matters relating to the advantage of the body, and being able almost always to make use of more than a single sense in examining the same object, and besides this, being able to use my memory in connecting present with past knowledge, and my understanding which has already discovered all the causes of my errors, I ought no longer to fear that falsity may be met with in what is daily presented to me by the senses. And I ought to reject all the doubts of those bygone days, as hyperbolical and ridiculous, especially the general uncertainty respecting sleep, which I could not distinguish from the waking state: for I now find a very marked difference between the two states, in respect that our memory can never connect our dreams with each other and with the course of life, in the way it is in the habit of doing with events that occur when we are awake. And, in truth, if some one, when I am awake, appeared to me all of a sudden and as suddenly disappeared, as do the images I see in sleep, so that I could not observe either whence he came or whither he went, I should not without reason esteem it either a specter or phantom formed in my brain, rather than a real man. But when I perceive objects with regard to which I can distinctly determine both the place whence they come, and that in which they are, and the time at which they appear to me, and when, without interruption, I can connect the perception I have of them with the whole of the other parts of my life, I am perfectly sure that what I thus perceive occurs while I am awake and not during sleep. And I ought not in the least degree to doubt of the truth of these presentations, if, after having called together all my senses, my memory, and my understanding for the purpose of examining them, no deliverance is given by any one of these faculties which is repugnant to that of any other: for since God is no deceiver, it necessarily follows that I am not herein deceived. But because the necessities of action frequently oblige us to come to a determination before we have had leisure for so careful an examination, it must be confessed that the life of man is frequently obnoxious to error with respect to individual objects; and we must, in conclusion, acknowledge the weakness of our nature.",Yes,http://www.philosophy-index.com/descartes/meditations/vi.php,Descartes,Meditation Six

"Mr. Melki (France) (spoke in French): We welcome the adoption of resolution 2466 (2019), which renews the mandate of the United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti for the last time. The text, which includes a mention of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, provides the Mission with the necessary means to conclude the tasks that were entrusted to it, implement all the recommendations of the Secretary-General and enable the Secretariat to expedite the transition to a special political mission focused on providing strategic advice to Haitian authorities, especially the Haitian National Police. This final renewal of the mandate is not only a new page that is being turned in the relations between the United Nations and Haiti, but a new chapter altogether.

"Just a week ago, the Security Council discussed the situation in the country (see S/PV.8502). At that time, despite the concern about the tensions in the country on the eve of elections, most members of the Security Council shared the Security-General’s assessment that the Government and the Haitian National Police would be able to assume full responsibility for security in the country by October. However, to our confusion, the authors of the MINUJUSTH resolution have for two years now pursued a hard line, expanding the application of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations to the entire mandate, including human rights monitoring. We continue to fail to understand how the human rights situation in a country where an armed conflict has long been over presents a threat to international peace and security.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8510,UN Security Council Transcript,8510th Session
"There is another reason for our being unable to support resolution 2466 (2019), namely, the comprehensive and integrated performance policy framework that the penholder has entrusted the Secretary-General to apply to the Mission in Haiti. Let us recall that work on this policy framework has not yet been concluded, and that if it is finalized before the drawdown of the peacekeeping presence in Haiti, then, according to the proper procedures, the policy framework must be discussed by States Members of the United Nations in relevant platforms before it can be applied.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8510,UN Security Council Transcript,8510th Session
"The fact that Council members have divergent views is not unusual. However, we are disappointed that the American penholder has blatantly ignored the concerns of other members of the Council. Consensus could have been achieved. To that end, we proposed specific, balanced options on this matter, but unfortunately they were ignored. Such an approach gives rise to serious concern as we begin discussions on a special political mission to replace the peacekeeping presence in the country.

"The President: I will now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Germany. I would like to make four points. First, we support the extension of the United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH) for a final period of six months. Secondly, I would like to echo the sentiments of the representatives of Peru and the Dominican Republic that the United Nations should remain engaged with Haiti and that we should have a smooth transition to the follow-up United Nations presence, the special political mission, in Haiti. We believe that this is of crucial importance. Thirdly, in response to my Russian colleague with regard to the relationship between Chapter VII and human rights monitoring, we believe that the respect for human rights is a question of security and therefore rightfully within the mandate. The presence of Ms. Bachelet in our discussions last week (see S/PV.8502) was proof of this. Fourthly, I would like to highlight that Haiti is among the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change and natural disasters. When we look at the island from space, we can see that one half is absolutely green and the other half has hardly any trees, which makes this country particularly susceptible to natural disasters. We would have liked to have something on this issue in resolution 2466 (2019). and we regret that this was not possible. We believe that a future United Nations presence should provide advice to the Haitian Government on how to strengthen the country’s resilience with respect to the challenges of climate change. I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council. There are no more names inscribed on the list of speakers. The meeting rose at 10.40 a.m.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8510,UN Security Council Transcript,8510th Session

"In accordance with rule 39 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure, I invite the following briefers to participate in this meeting: Mrs. Izumi Nakamitsu, Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, and Mr. Yukiya Amano, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"I shall now make several remarks in my national capacity. Today’s meeting is a timely opportunity to take stock of the achievements made under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and lay the ground for future progress. As we move towards the 2020 Review Conference against a challenging security background, the Security Council can, and should, make its contribution to its successful outcome in 2020. I would like to highlight that the Council is made up not only of the five nuclear-weapon States recognized by the NPT, including all three depositary States, but also 10 non-nuclear-weapon States that are firmly committed to the goals of the NPT; some of them are also dedicated members of different nuclear-weapon-free zones. That composition underlines the responsibility of the Security Council for the NPT and the relevance of the exchange that we are having today. Advancing the goals of the NPT across its three pillars — nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful uses of nuclear applications — is at the core of members’ assignments. We are grateful for their presence, and we look forward to hearing their statements. I now resume my functions as President of the Council. I give the floor to Mrs. Nakamitsu.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Mrs. Nakamitsu: I congratulate the German presidency for convening today’s briefing. The possible use of nuclear weapons, either intentionally, by accident or through miscalculation, is one of the greatest threats to international peace and security. The potential consequences of a nuclear war would be global and affect all Member States. Therefore, it is entirely appropriate that the Security Council discuss measures related to preventing such a catastrophic outcome, and in particular the one instrument that has perhaps played the greatest role in doing so. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) has been an enduring feature of the international security landscape for nearly 50 years. The NPT is widely acknowledged as the cornerstone of the international non-proliferation regime and the essential foundation of nuclear disarmament. Its role as a pillar of our collective security is likewise an accepted fact.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"There are four key elements to the success of the Treaty. First, it includes verifiable non-proliferation obligations in the form of safeguards on peaceful nuclear activities. Secondly, it is the only treaty that includes legally binding commitments to pursue nuclear disarmament. Thirdly, the Treaty establishes a strategic balance across the three pillars of nuclear disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and access to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in ways that seek to maximize their benefits for all States parties. Fourthly, its near universality provides clear authority and ensures almost global subscription to its normative framework.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Throughout its long history, the NPT has provided tangible security benefits not just for its States parties but for all States. That President Kennedy’s dire prediction that there would be between 10 and 20 nuclear-armed States by the 1970s did not come true can largely be attributed to the NPT. That, there are only four States with nuclear-weapon capabilities, or suspected capabilities, outside the Treaty in 2019 remains one of the greatest success stories of multilateral diplomacy. We can all agree that the spread of nuclear weapons to a greater number of States equates with a greater possibility of their use. That that has not happened is because of the value States parties continue to place in their membership of the NPT and the non-proliferation benefits it provides.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"We must today reconfirm that the security benefits that have been derived from the implementation of article VI — those related to
nuclear disarmament — have been equally important.
Under the leadership of the nuclear-weapon States,
States parties’ efforts to implement article VI helped
ease global tension, reduced great Power conflict and
built confidence among nuclear-armed competitors.
Reductions in nuclear arsenals, frameworks to reduce
nuclear risk and efforts to drive forward multilateral
nuclear disarmament are all effective measures under
article VI, and every one of them helped to create
an environment conducive to broader international
cooperation for various global challenges of our
time, from peace and security to development and
climate change.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Two pillars of the NPT — disarmament and non-proliferation — are two sides of the same coin. Backward movement on one will result in backward movement on the other. The implementation of commitments made under both strengthens mutual trust and advances the cause of a world free of nuclear weapons. As the Secretary-General has stressed, disarmament and non-proliferation are important mechanisms that help make the world safer and more secure. They are measures to help prevent, mitigate and resolve conflict, and can and should be pursued in tandem with other peacemaking and security processes.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"The NPT has proven to be remarkably durable. However, that durability should not be taken for granted. Today, we find ourselves in an international environment defined by competition over cooperation, and the acquisition of arms prioritized over the pursuit of diplomacy. The disarmament success of the postCold War era has come to a halt. In its place, there is dangerous rhetoric about the utility of nuclear weapons and an increased reliance on these weapons in security doctrines. Expensive modernization programmes that will make nuclear weapons faster, stealthier and more accurate have effectively announced the arrival of a qualitative nuclear arms race. Rapid technological developments will begin to impact our international security environment in many different ways, including by potentially lowering barriers to the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Last but not least, regional conflicts might heighten proliferation drivers.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"The disarmament and arms control framework upon which the gains of the post-Cold War era were made is eroding, but we have nothing else yet with which to replace it. As a result, the prospect of the use of nuclear weapons is higher than it has been in generations. Together, these developments are placing
the NPT under increasing stress and are exacerbating
the fault lines that have been clearly evident between
States parties for some time now. In this context, the
2020 Review Conference will be a defining moment.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"I do not believe that the failure to achieve consensus in 2020 necessarily signals the demise of the Treaty, but it would set a poor precedent and it would further highlight divisions between States parties. It would raise questions about the willingness of States to seek collective security for all, rather than narrow, shortterm and eventually unsustainable security benefits for individual States. I believe that we should avoid this situation.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"The year 2020 — the fiftieth anniversary of the NPT’s entry into force and the twenty-fifth anniversary of its indefinite extension — presents a golden opportunity to make the practical gains that will ensure the Treaty’s continued viability. A strong, political-level re-affirmation by all to the Treaty will be important. In the short time remaining between now and 2020, I hope that States parties will consider four things.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"First, there is a need for demonstrated implementation by all States parties of commitments made during previous review cycles. Past commitments cannot be arbitrarily abrogated or else they become no more valuable than the paper on which they are written. The failure of implementation undermines potential future gains across all three of the Treaty’s pillars.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Secondly, we need genuine dialogue about our current predicament in international security and how the NPT can be a vehicle to reduce nuclear risk and enhance stability in ways that also take concrete steps towards nuclear disarmament.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Thirdly, there is a need to ensure the strategic balance between the pillars. The NPT is often described as a grand bargain. I see it more as a series of bargains or, rather, commitments made. It is important to recognize that they are all mutually reinforcing.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Fourthly, we need creative thinking about what a successful outcome in 2020 will look like.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Since 1995, review conferences have produced decisions, action plans, practical steps and measures to improve the effectiveness of the review process itself. In 2020, States parties will need to consider what possible outcome can both ensure success and drive forward implementation of the Treaty.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"The security benefits provided by the NPT have been manifest in times of relative stability. They should be even more so in an era of international turbulence. The NPT should be a mechanism through which to help create a safer and more secure world. It should be a basis on which to build trust and confidence, to address emerging threats and challenges, and to lay the ground for future gains in the pursuit of our collective goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. Whatever a new arms control and disarmament approach in the twentyfirst century might look like, one thing is clear — the NPT will still be at the centre of our collective security mechanism. It will have to stay fit for purpose.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
I remain convinced the 2020 Review Conference will be an opportunity to make headway on all of these goals and to make sure that this linchpin of international security remains fit for purpose through the next 25 or even 50 years.,No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
The President: I thank Mrs. Nakamitsu for her briefing. I now give the floor to Mr. Amano.,No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Mr. Amano: Let me begin by thanking you, Sir, for taking the initiative to host this important meeting on strengthening the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). As Council members know, the most recent NPT Review Conference in 2015 did not reach consensus on a final document. The previous final document, in 2010, recognized that, “IAEA safeguards are a fundamental component of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, play an indispensable role in the implementation of the Treaty and help to create an environment conducive to nuclear cooperation” (NPT/CONF.2010/50 (Vol. I), Part I, para. 11). It also underlined the role of the Agency in assisting developing countries in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"With our atoms for peace and development mandate, the Agency has supported the United Nations in all NPT review conferences. I believe that our dual role of nuclear verification and assisting with peaceful uses is highly relevant to States parties to the NPT.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
now implements safeguards in 182 countries, 179 of
which are NPT States parties. Non-nuclear-weapon States are required under the NPT to conclude a
comprehensive safeguards agreement with the IAEA
They must declare all nuclear material in peaceful
nuclear activities.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"The safeguards conclusions drawn by the Agency, which are based on our independent verification and findings, provide credible assurance to the international community that States are abiding by their safeguards obligations. In 1997, the IAEA Board of Governors approved the model additional protocol. This is a powerful verification tool that gives the Agency broader access to information about all parts of a State’s nuclear fuel cycle. It also gives our inspectors greater access to sites and locations, in some cases with as little as two hours’ notice.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"In 2009, when I became IAEA Director General, only 94 countries were implementing the additional protocols; today 134 countries have brought them into force, which is very encouraging. However, the combination of comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols needs to become universal. I encourage States parties to the NPT without comprehensive safeguards agreements in force to bring such agreements into force without delay. I also ask all countries that have not yet done so to bring into force and implement additional protocols",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"The steady increase in the amount of nuclear material and the number of nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards, along with continuing pressure on our regular budget, are among the key challenges facing the Agency today. Under the IAEA Statute, inspections must be financed through the regular budget. For some years, our regular budget has had close to zero increases — this year it has actually been cut. If our regular budget continues to suffer cuts in the coming years, it could seriously affect our nuclearverification activities.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"The nuclear programmes of Iran and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea remain among the top items on the Agency’s agenda. The IAEA has focused on Iran’s nuclear activities since 2002. I presented a final assessment on past and present outstanding issues regarding Iran’s nuclear programme to the IAEA Board of Governors in December 2015. I stated that Iran had conducted a range of activities relevant to the development of a nuclear-explosive device before the end of 2003. However, those activities did not advance beyond feasibility and scientific studies and the acquisition of certain relevant technical competences
and capabilities. I also stated that we had no credible
indications of activities in Iran relevant to the
development of a nuclear-explosive device after 2009.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"The Agency has been verifying and monitoring Iran’s implementation of its nuclear-related commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) since January 2016. I have stated in my regular reports to the Board that Iran is implementing those commitments. It is essential that Iran continue to fully implement them. Our inspectors have had access to all the sites and locations in Iran that they needed to visit. The Agency continues to verify the non-diversion of nuclear material declared by Iran under its NPT Safeguards Agreement. Evaluations regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran continue. The implementation in Iran of the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement, the Additional Protocol and additional transparency measures under the JCPOA amounts to the most robust verification system in existence anywhere in the world.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"It is almost 10 years since IAEA inspectors were required to leave North Korea. The Agency continues to monitor the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s nuclear programme and evaluate all safeguards-relevant information available to it, including open-source information and satellite imagery. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s nuclear programme has significantly expanded over the past 10 years. The country announced in 2009 that it would start uranium enrichment and build a light-water reactor. It announced in 2013 that it would take measures to readjust and restart all the nuclear facilities in Yongbyon.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"The Agency has since then observed indications of the operation of the 5-megawatt reactor and reprocessing plant, the extension of the building housing the reported centrifuge enrichment facility, and the construction of the light-water reactor. Since 2009, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has announced on five separate occasions that it had conducted a nuclear test, in addition to the one announced in 2006. Activities at some facilities continued or developed further over the past year, while some other facilities appeared not to be operating. I report regularly to our Board on those activities. Without access, however, the Agency cannot confirm the nature and purpose of those activities",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"The IAEA closely follows international developments on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea nuclear issue. We hope that these processes will lead to an
agreement and to the implementation of concrete
denuclearization measures. The Agency does not have
a role in political negotiations among the countries
concerned. However, it is very important that any
agreement on denuclearization be accompanied by an
effective and sustainable verification mechanism. With
its long experience and well-established practices, the
IAEA is the only international organization that can
verify and monitor denuclearization in an impartial,
independent and objective manner. That would help to
make the implementation of any agreement sustainable.
It would also contribute to the denuclearization of the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in a complete,
verifiable and irreversible manner, as required by
numerous resolutions of the Security Council.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Since 2017, the Agency has intensified its efforts to monitor the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea nuclear programme and enhanced its readiness to undertake verification and monitoring activities in the country if a political agreement is reached among the countries concerned. Subject to the approval of our Board of Governors, we could respond within weeks to any request to send inspectors back to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Let me note briefly that the IAEA makes an important contribution to the establishment of a world free of nuclear weapons in a number of ways. We assist States in creating nuclear-weapon-free zones, which already cover vast regions of the world. In 2012, for example, the Agency provided background documentation to the facilitator for the United Nations conference on the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction. It described the work undertaken by the IAEA and the experience gained concerning modalities for a zone free of nuclear weapons in the Middle East. If requested by Member States, the IAEA can play a role in nuclear disarmament by sharing its experience in the implementation of verification.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"The IAEA Technical Cooperation Programme is the main vehicle for the transfer of nuclear technology, based on the Agency’s Statute and on requests from Member States. While the focus of our technical cooperation work is on developing countries, we provide assistance to all IAEA member States. The Agency helps to improve the health and prosperity of millions of people by making nuclear science and technology available in the areas of health care, food
and agriculture, industry and many others.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"An extensive modernization of our nuclear applications laboratories at Seibersdorf, near Vienna, is nearly complete, thanks to generous contributions from many Member States. That will enable us to deliver improved services to member States to make food safer, improve control of harmful insect pests and maximize the benefits of new radiation technology for cancer treatment, to name just a few examples. Helping countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by using relevant nuclear technology is an important part of our work. In fact, the IAEA helps countries to use nuclear science and technology to meet at least 9 of the 17 SDGs directly.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"The IAEA Peaceful Uses Initiative, which was launched in 2010, provides additional funds for our technical cooperation activities. It has helped to raise over €140 million for around 300 projects that benefit more than 150 countries. I am grateful to all the countries that support that valuable initiative.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Nuclear power can help address the twin challenges of ensuring reliable energy supplies and curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Today, nuclear power produces 10 per cent of the world’s electricity, but when it comes to low-carbon electricity, nuclear power generates almost one-third of the global total.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"The Agency’s latest annual projections show that nuclear power will continue to play a key role in the world’s low-carbon energy mix. However, without significant progress on using the full potential of nuclear power, it will be difficult for the world to secure sufficient energy to achieve sustainable development and mitigate climate change.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Our work in nuclear security is one of our highpriority issues. By helping prevent nuclear and other radioactive material from falling into the hands of terrorists or other criminals, the Agency makes an additional important contribution to international
security. The next IAEA international conference on
nuclear security will take place at the ministerial level

The President: I thank Mr. Amano for his briefing. Mrs. Nakamitsu and Mr. Amano have illustrated the extent to which the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) has contributed to peace and security since its entry into force. They have also highlighted the efforts that are needed to add more chapters to the success story of the NPT. I shall now make a statement in my capacity as Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany.,No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"There is a saying that one never really misses something until it is gone. But there are some things that we cannot afford to lose. One such item is the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Let us imagine for a minute that the NPT had never existed. Far more States would have nuclear weapons. There would have been nothing to put the brakes on the nuclear programmes still running after the Cold War. Mutual distrust would be much higher. In short, our world would be far less safe. The NPT is a good example that illustrates what Finnish diplomat Martti Koskenniemi means when he describes international law as the gentle civilizer of nations.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Another such civilizer is the International Atomic Energy Agency. Let us just think what the world would be like without the Agency. We would not have such high universal safeguarding standards. We would not have civilian reactor technology, which, in most countries, runs without highly enriched uranium. Three hundred safeguards agreements reached, 1,500 cameras installed, 3,000 on-site inspections conducted and more than 1 million documents evaluated — none
of that would have happened.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"The International Atomic Energy Agency also plays an indispensable role in the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which is a milestone in non-proliferation diplomacy. That is why we have to do everything possible to ensure that the Agency can continue its work in an independent and neutral manner. That applies to the case of North Korea, for instance, where we need the International Atomic Energy Agency’s verification capabilities. It is simply unacceptable for North Korea to become the first country to establish itself as a nuclear Power by openly violating the NPT. The proliferation risk would be immense, it would add fuel to the fire of rearmament and, finally, it would reward the bad behaviour of a country that has repeatedly ignored Security Council resolutions. North Korea needs to embark on a credible process of denuclearization; that is what we expect, not least as Chair of the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1718 (2006).",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"If we want to maintain the NPT and its universality, we need to preserve the balance at its heart — the balance among nuclear non-proliferation, the peaceful use of nuclear technology and the nuclear disarmament imperative. In concrete terms, the 2020 NPT review conference needs to make it clear that article VI of the Treaty still applies. The recognized nuclear-weapon States need to disarm too; that is their duty, and we expect them to fulfil it. Also, it is high time to ensure the appointment of the President of the review conference in order to make progress. We need a road map that will get us back on track with nuclear disarmament. I would like to outline three specific elements here.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"First, we need to take tangible steps towards strategic risk reduction. We need more transparency on nuclear arsenals, crisis-proof channels of communication and a revived dialogue among the permanent five members of the Security Council, which carry particular nuclear responsibility.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Secondly, we have to lay the technical groundwork for a world free of nuclear weapons. Perhaps the most important part of that is credible verification. For instance, how can non-nuclear-weapon States verify the proper dismantling of a nuclear warhead without gaining access to its blueprints? Seeking answers to that question, Germany and France will jointly host a disarmament verification exercise in September, to
which members of the Council are all invited.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Thirdly, we must strengthen and develop the architecture of nuclear arms control. We have been biding our time for far too long. Let us start negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty. Different views on certain aspects should be clarified during negotiations; they should not hinder the start of negotiations. And let us finally get the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty into force. Nuclear tests should be a thing of the past.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Whether in Europe, Asia or anywhere else, we cannot afford any more shocks to our security and stability. We must also preserve crucial and effective treaties like the New START Treaty, which not only contributes to security between the United States and Russia, but is also a pillar of security in Europe and of the global nuclear order, and fulfils an obligation that arises directly out of the NPT. I firmly believe that further reductions are possible — without any loss of security. The United States and Russia could and should continue to cut the number of warheads and delivery systems.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Especially in times of increasingly divergent positions, we must preserve our achievements. The NPT is a universal achievement and a gentle civilizer of nations, and we must safeguard its future in 2020. That job will require energy and commitment from all of us. Our shared security and peace around the world are surely worth it. I now resume my functions as President of the Council. I give the floor to the other Council members who wish to make statements. I now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Mrs. Marsudi (Indonesia): The very existence of nuclear weapons is threatening the world’s existence. Their total elimination is the only guarantee of avoiding a global catastrophe. Indonesia is therefore a strong and consistent supporter of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), whose objectives can be achieved only through a balanced, comprehensive and non-discriminatory implementation of its three pillars. In that regard, I wish to emphasize three points.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"First, Indonesia continues to make nuclear disarmament its highest priority. That is our longstanding position both at the national level and as a member of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. Yet, despite the successful outcome of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT, the disarmament pillar is the least implemented. I repeat — the disarmament pillar is the least implemented. We should not forget that non-proliferation earns its legitimacy from the larger objective of nuclear disarmament. When non-nuclear-weapon States give up their rights to such weapons, nuclear-weapon States have to disarm. Furthermore, treaties on nuclear-weapon-free zones, including the Treaty on the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone and Mongolia’s nuclearweapon-free status, are crucial to global disarmament and non-proliferation. Indonesia therefore calls upon all nuclear-weapon States to ratify the relevant protocols to all treaties establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones, withdraw any reservations or interpretative declarations that are incompatible with their object and purpose, and respect the denuclearization status of those zones.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"My second point is that we must ensure the right of all States to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The NPT enjoys wide support, despite barring proliferation, because it guarantees the right to peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In that connection, Indonesia would like to affirm that nuclear non-proliferation should not bar peaceful use, that preferential treatment should be given to non-nuclear-weapon States for the promotion of peaceful uses of nuclear energy and that all parties should continue to support the International Atomic Energy Agency in discharging its safeguards and verification mandate.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Thirdly, we must focus on the ultimate objective of the NPT. All parties must support the NPT process. As such, the intention to dismantle existing disarmament arrangements is damaging to our spirit and commitments, and therefore must be prevented. With great power comes great responsibility. We urge the nuclear-weapon States to set a positive example that better reflects their responsibilities.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"We regret that the 2015 Review Conference of the States Parties to the NPT was unable to produce an outcome. Nevertheless, we must remain committed to the 2020 review conference and beyond, and make every effort to avoid another failure. This time, we must ensure that any outcome of the 2020 review conference should be no less ambitious than or backtrack from the commitments of the previous outcomes. That
will require genuine political will and flexibility on
the part of the nuclear-weapon States. Indonesia also
believes that once the Treaty on the Prohibition of
Nuclear Weapons enters into force, it will contribute
to furthering the objective of the total elimination of
nuclear weapons, as enshrined in article VI of the NPT.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Finally, former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon once underlined that a world free of nuclear weapons would be safer and more prosperous. Therefore, let us all affirm our commitment to the NPT and make nuclear weapons a thing of the past. Indonesia stands ready to engage constructively with everyone in the NPT process.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
The President: I give the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland.,No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Mr. Czaputowicz (Poland): Nuclear affairs are back on top of the agenda of international politics and every day brings news on nuclear issues. Politicians attach the utmost importance to topics like the denuclearization of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the further implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and the erosion of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. They have dominated international political discourse in recent months. In the past year alone, the President of Poland has twice had the occasion to speak on nuclear non-proliferation in this forum (see S/PV.8160 and S/PV.8362).",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"There is no doubt that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) has been a fundamental document and remains the only global, legally binding instrument that commits the nuclearweapon States to continuing negotiations towards nuclear disarmament. It also requires all its States parties to pursue general and complete disarmament and to refrain from acquiring nuclear weapons. Since its adoption, the NPT has become an important part of international law and a universal standard. Over the years, the NPT has proved its value in containing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, setting standards of responsible behaviour in that domain and providing a platform for cooperation between nuclear- and non-nuclear-weapon States.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"The NPT has adapted successfully to the changing circumstances. That has been possible thanks to the existing instruments that have enabled consistent improvements, in the form of the preparatory committees and the review conferences, which have
made it possible to air ideas and to test various solutions.
Next year, we will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of
NPT’s entry into force.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"The NPT regime has unfolded along three main pillars: disarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. All are mutually enabling, reinforcing and balancing elements. The first two aspects could be described as a work in progress, at best. Despite the achievements in reducing nuclear warheads and their means of delivery, further progress remains a serious challenge. The main reason for that is a very complicated and unpredictable international security environment, which is not conducive to pursuing further disarmament efforts.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
Non-compliance is the most serious challenge that the NPT is facing today. The failure of some States to comply with the NPT’s provisions and their safeguards obligations — the case in point was the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea — erodes confidence and undermines the goals of the Treaty.,No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"The last pillar — the peaceful use of nuclear energy — has, however, been the least controversial and largely successful. Under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency, technical support has been created. It offers a wide array of programmes to support nuclear-related research and development, national legislative frameworks, and international cooperative efforts.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"The NPT’s efficiency must be strengthened, in our opinion. It is the only comprehensive instrument aimed at stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons, while preserving the right of States to pursue civil nuclear energy. Thanks to the NPT regime, transparency has immensely increased. The verification instruments are becoming more and more effective. That would not be possible without the consistent support of institutions, including the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization and the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"We should focus on closing the gaps in the NPT system. That includes working towards the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, the commencement of negotiations on a treaty banning the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other explosive devices — the fissile material cut-off treaty — and the establishment of a robust and credible verification regime of nuclear disarmament measures. In that regard, we welcome the work of the International
Partnership for Nuclear Disarmament Verification and
the Group of Governmental Experts to consider the role
of verification in advancing nuclear disarmament, in
which Poland is actively engaged.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Let me address the challenges to the NPT regime arising from East Asia, the Middle East and Europe.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"First, the nuclear programme of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea still presents a challenge to the NPT. Despite encouraging diplomatic developments on the Korean peninsula, a lasting peace will not be achieved without the denuclearization of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner, in accordance with several Security Council resolutions.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Secondly, it is in our common interest to stabilize the situation in the Middle East, reduce tensions in the region and, most importantly, to prevent the further proliferation of nuclear weapons. In order to address those concerns, Poland, together with the United States, organized in Warsaw the Ministerial Conference to Promote a Future of Peace and Security in the Middle East. One of its deliverables was the decision to establish a working group on curbing missile development and proliferation.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Thirdly, we are firm in our conviction that Iran must continue to fulfil all of its nuclear-related commitments under the NPT, as well as the JCPOA. In that regard, we welcome the International Atomic Energy Agency’s efforts to strictly monitor and verify Iran’s commitments. We should find a way forward on the operationalization of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. New, creative ideas based on a realistic evaluation of regional needs are needed.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Fourthly, in Europe, a return to full compliance by the Russian Federation is the only way to save the INF Treaty. Unless the Russian Federation destroys in a verifiable way all of its 9M729 missile systems, it will bear the sole responsibility for the end of the INF Treaty. That will have a significant impact on the strategic stability of Europe and, as such, on the current NPT review cycle.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Upholding the rules-based order reflects the long-term objectives of the Polish security policy. My country has been a committed and pragmatic supporter of strengthening non-proliferation norms. Our priorities focus on securing widespread and credible
verification mechanisms, better implementation of
safeguards, stronger risk-reduction measures and
tighter international cooperation in nuclear safety and
security. During Poland’s chairmanship last year of the
second session of the Preparatory Committee for the
2020 NPT review conference, we outlined paths to a
successful outcome of the upcoming review conference
by presenting the Chair’s summary and reflection on
the state of the NPT. We hope they will constitute a
point of departure for our successors in upholding the
integrity and credibility of the NPT and securing its
effective implementation.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Close cooperation between the Polish and Dutch Chairs of the Preparatory Committees remains fundamental in that respect. New mechanisms of cooperation among the consecutive Chairs have contributed to strengthening the review cycle. They include regular consultations, an exchange of knowhow, the organization of regional conferences and experts’ support.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"The NPT is not a perfect instrument, nor has its implementation been perfect. However, without the NPT, the world would have been much less stable and secure. It is our collective duty to ensure its viability in the years to come. The 2020 review conference must be a collective success. To that end, we must focus on common interests, build bridges where differences persist and take bold steps where we see opportunities for deeper and wider cooperation. Only then can we live up to our common obligations.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
The President: I now give the floor to the Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France.,No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Mr. Le Drian (France) (spoke in French): At the outset, I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for having taken the initiative to convene this important debate. I would also like to thank Mrs. Nakamitsu and Mr. Amano for their very enlightening briefings at the beginning of our meeting.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"As the international security environment continues to deteriorate and the nuclear threat is making a forceful reappearance, it is crucial to preserve the integrity of existing non-proliferation norms and to consolidate a multilateral, rules-based order. As President of the Republic Emmanuel Macron recalled in this Chamber last September (see S/PV.8362), it is important to reaffirm unambiguously the essential nature of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) for international security. The NPT remains the
cornerstone of global strategic stability. It represents
an irreplaceable bulwark against the risk of nuclear
proliferation. Fifty years after its signing, the Treaty is
an undeniable success for three reasons.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"First, since 1968 the NPT has led a number of States in Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Pacific to abandon their nuclear weapons. Only a few States have developed arsenals outside the NPT. Secondly, the NPT has enabled the peaceful development of nuclear energy under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Today, nuclear energy is an important source of low-carbon electricity for some 50 States. Non-energy applications of nuclear technology are even more widespread. Finally, the NPT has led to drastic reductions — on the order of 80 per cent — in nuclear arsenals from the levels seen during the Cold War.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"That success has not been achieved without crises along the way. Clandestine nuclear facilities and activities, which were not declared to the IAEA, were discovered first in Iraq and then in North Korea, Libya, Iran and Syria. Non-state clandestine networks, in particular the Abdul Qadeer Khan Network, played an important role in that series of crises. The involvement of the Security Council, the perseverance of its members, the determination of everyone and the work of the IAEA made it possible to overcome them, with the notable exception of that of North Korea, despite the recent decrease in tensions. In most cases, those results were achieved diplomatically. The NPT has survived despite that succession of shocks because its States parties have remained determined to preserve it.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Accordingly, despite a risky environment, safeguarding the NPT is more essential than ever. It is more essential than ever because the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery has not disappeared. It is essential because the reduction in the American and Russian arsenals, by far the most massive, remains in place. The expectation for nuclear disarmament remains high in international opinion, which has led some to favour an exclusively declaratory approach by seeking a ban on nuclear weapons, while disarmament cannot be decreed. Only concrete actions count. Finally, safeguarding the NPT is essential because energy needs are constantly increasing all over the world and the fight against carbon dioxide (CO²) emissions also involves nuclear energy, which has made it possible for France, for example, to be below the world average for
carbon dioxide CO² production per capita. ",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"How, then, can we consolidate the NPT, and what should our collective road map be? Above all, the balance of the three pillars of the NPT must be respected. As mentioned by several speakers, it is a legitimate expectation of everyone. First, we must adopt a firm and united response to nuclear proliferation, with the highest priority necessarily being resolving the North Korean crisis. The North Korean nuclear and ballistic threat remains intolerable. NPT States parties must make clear their expectations of North Korea. The latter must implement the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling of its nuclear and ballistic programmes in accordance with the resolutions of the Council. At that point, the sanctions can be lifted.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"With regard to Iran, our objective in the nuclear field is twofold: preserve the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and come to an agreement on how to oversee Iran’s nuclear programme for the long term. There is no way we will accept Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. I would add that agreement will have to be reached to reduce the threat of Iran’s missile programme, which is only growing despite the Security Council’s calls.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Beyond crises, we will continue to rely on the IAEA. France hopes that States that have not yet done so will be able to accede to the additional protocol. And because the threat of nuclear or radiological terrorism is real, all measures in support of resolution 1540 (2004) must be strengthened.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Moreover, for the future, we must promote progressive nuclear disarmament. The NPT was conceived 50 years ago when the role of nuclear deterrence was recognized — a role that remains in several regions of the world. Yet France wants all States to commit themselves to creating the conditions for a world without nuclear weapons, with undiminished security for all. That is also consistent with the goal of general and complete disarmament set out in article VI of the Treaty.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Accordingly, in terms of concrete actions, we can propose several. First, the United States and Russia, which still hold nearly 90 per cent of the nuclear arsenals, must continue their concerted efforts to reduce them. Secondly, the negotiation in the Conference on Disarmament of a treaty banning the production of fissile material is essential to exclude the risk of a resumption of the arms race. It is an essential step on the road to a world without nuclear weapons. Thirdly,
the early entry into force of the Comprehensive NuclearTest-Ban Treaty remains essential. It is the necessary
key to preventing new weapons from being designed.
We call on all the States concerned to sign and ratify this
instrument and to support the Comprehensive NuclearTest-Ban Treaty Organization. Fourthly, work on the
verification of nuclear disarmament is also important
for confidence-building, and it is worth extending.
Fifthly, the reduction of strategic risks associated
with nuclear weapons is based on the transparency
of nuclear doctrines, dialogue between political and
military leaders, crisis communication instruments and
reassurance measures. Much has been done since the
birth of deterrence; those efforts must continue.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"In conclusion, let me say a few words on civil nuclear power, which must be pursued in the best conditions of safety and security. Through numerous partnerships, France supports countries that wish to embark on this path or develop it. France’s voluntary contribution to the IAEA Technical Cooperation Fund will be maintained in this regard.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"As Council members will have understood, France will continue to work to ensure that the main equilibrium of our nuclear non-proliferation system is maintained and that we are able to strengthen it with new binding measures. We are at the disposal of all those who wish to embark on this path in good faith.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session

"Sheikh Al Sabah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): To begin with, I would like to commend the initiative of your country’s delegation, Mr. President, to convene this formal public meeting under the agenda item “Non-proliferation”. This meeting is being held before the convening of the next Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), to be held in May 2020. I would like to extend my thanks to Mr. Yukiya Amano, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and Mrs. Izumi Nakamitsu, Under-SecretaryGeneral and High Representative for Disarmament Affairs for their informative briefings.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Over the past months, the issue of nuclear non-proliferation has seen a momentum that is not witnessed since the high-level meeting of the Security Council in 2009 at which resolution 1887 (2009) was adopted (see S/PV.6191). The resolution reaffirms
that the NPT remains the cornerstone of the nuclear
non-proliferation regime and the main pillar in efforts
aimed at denuclearization and the peaceful use of
nuclear energy. That momentum continued through the
2010 NPT Review Conference, where an agreement
was reached that led to the Action Plan that gave the
peoples of the world a glimpse of hope that concrete
measures would be achieved in terms of ridding
the world of nuclear weapons and other weapons of

"We are meeting again at a high-level after few months of participating in the Security Council’s highlevel meeting in September 2018 (see S/PV.8362), to reaffirm the threat of nuclear proliferation, stress the high priority given by the Council to the NPT and address this menace to humankind, based on the Council’s responsibility to prevent conflict and maintain international peace and security. In that regard, I would like to reiterate the principled and firm position of the State of Kuwait regarding NPT issues. We condemn the use of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction at any time, any place and by whomsoever. We consider such use to be a serious violation of international law. We also reiterate our steadfast commitment to the NPT and the achievement of its universality, in order to preserve and promote the international NPT regime.

"It is undeniable that the NPT plays a critical role in the maintenance of international peace and security. The three broad objectives of the NPT, namely, nuclear disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, are inextricably linked and mutually reinforcing. Therefore, in our view, efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons should be matched by an equal commitment by the nuclearweapon States to eliminate all nuclear weapons in a verifiable and irreversible manner. As such, the support of the Council for the full and balanced implementation of all the objectives of the NPT is paramount.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Regrettably, we remain disheartened at the apparent lack of urgency and seriousness with which nuclear disarmament has been approached in the NPT context. This state of affairs places the Treaty, as well as its review process, under increasing pressure and falls far short of expectations.

The 2020 Review Conference should likewise not roll back or reinterpret previously agreed commitments, which constitute the current nuclear-disarmament benchmarks. While we are aware that some States are arguing for the creation of a so-called special environment for nuclear disarmament, it is our view that this was already established with the entry into force of the NPT on the basis of its “grand bargain”.

We want to use this opportunity to encourage Member States that have not done so to sign and ratify the TPNW at the earliest possible time in order to ensure its early entry into force.

"The Security Council tackles some of the greatest challenges to international peace and security. But perhaps no challenge is more potent or more relevant to all of us than the further proliferation of nuclear weapons. We are approaching the fiftieth anniversary of the entry into force of the NPT. Over nearly five decades, the NPT has grown even more critical to the maintenance of international peace and security. It has made us all more secure by constraining the spread of nuclear weapons and has also thereby enabled the global peaceful use of nuclear energy and helped create conditions for progress on nuclear disarmament.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Fifty years ago, few would have dared to predict that we would be here today celebrating the success of the NPT. Before the NPT, United States Government national intelligence estimates had expressed dire concern about a possible snowball effect of cascading proliferation, which would increase the world’s nuclear
stockpile and undermine confidence in the ability of
non-proliferation policies to prevent such an action.
Yet, in a demonstration of remarkable diplomatic
resolve, the international community joined together
against that collective threat, reflecting rare consensus
during a time of Cold War polarization. Diplomatic
efforts culminated in the negotiation and entry into
force of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons. There has been unwavering international
consensus about the indispensable role of the Treaty
in maintaining collective peace and security. The NPT
has succeeded for half a century because it serves the
fundamental and widely recognized common interest
of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"We have also seen enormous progress on disarmament, in part because the NPT helped curtail the emergence of new nuclear Powers. With the easing of Cold War tensions and the success of the NPT-based non-proliferation regime in impeding proliferation, it has been possible to reduce the nuclear arsenals of both the United States and Russia to levels not seen since the 1950s. The stockpile of the United States today has been reduced to approximately 12 per cent of its Cold War peak.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"We must also recognize that advancing towards the ultimate goal of a world without nuclear weapons must take into account the global security environment.

"The United States is in the process of developing implementation plans for a path-breaking new initiative, entitled “Creating an environment for nuclear disarmament”. It is an initiative aimed at bringing countries together in a constructive dialogue, exploring ways in which it might be possible to ameliorate conditions in the global security environment so as to make further progress towards and ultimately achieve nuclear disarmament. In that regard, in addition to its emphasis on dialogue and diplomatic engagement with all relevant parties, the initiative stands in stark contrast to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, or the Ban Treaty, which fails to address the security challenges that continue to make nuclear deterrence necessary and seeks to stigmatize, rather than engage with, countries that rely upon nuclear deterrence for
their national security.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"As we turn towards the 2020 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the United States seeks a positive outcome of that meeting that reflects consensus on the broadest possible basis.

"Mr. Allen (United Kingdom): As we embark upon another review cycle for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), it is important that we, as the Security Council, charged with the maintenance of international peace and security, take a step back and consider the contribution made by the NPT to international stability. Over the past 50 years, the NPT has minimized the proliferation of nuclear weapons and provided the framework for significant nuclear disarmament. For example, the United Kingdom has more than halved the number of warheads it had at the height of the Cold War.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Of course, the NPT has not just been about prohibition. It has also provided the framework to develop secure and safe peaceful uses for nuclear energy globally, which ensures that the international community can have confidence in the safety of civilian
nuclear energy and, where proliferation does occur, the
NPT provides the framework for the Council’s action
to contain it. Under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of
Action, Iran is subjected to a rigorous programme
of inspections made possible by the architecture
underpinning the NPT; and while the Council continues
to demand that North Korea dismantle its nuclear
programme, its verification will ultimately need to be
conducted consistent with the NPT.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"As we approach another Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, we should keep in mind that there is more that unites us than our differences and that we all agree that we should strengthen the NPT going forward. The United Kingdom is committed to working with all partners to secure a positive outcome to the Review Conference process, which means resolving the issue of the presidency and agreeing an agenda for the 2020 Review Conference and its Preparatory Committee at its third session.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Despite those challenges, it is important that we continue to demonstrate progress on disarmament in a way that strengthens all of our security. That is why the United Kingdom is working on developing disarmament verification solutions, in particular with the United States, Sweden and Norway in the Quad Nuclear Verification Partnership. Establishing an effective verification regime will be vital if we are to realize our long-term goal of multilateral nuclear disarmament. States will need to have confidence that a nuclear-armed State has dismantled its warheads and — crucially — that they have been dismantled in a way that makes us safer rather than spreading nuclear knowledge.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Such work has demonstrated that non-nuclearweapon States can play an important role in the development of nuclear disarmament verification, while preventing proliferation. We encourage all States to fully participate in that process in order to continue to grow capacity for verification worldwide; and we very much welcome France and Germany’s joint verification exercise scheduled for later this year.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"We must all continue to promote the step-bystep approach, work for the universalization of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and promote the early commencement and conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty at the
Conference on Disarmament.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Allow me to outline some of the steps that the United Kingdom is taking to support a successful outcome of the Review Conference. We will be submitting a draft implementation report to the Preparatory Committee, setting out how we have implemented the NPT in this review cycle. We encourage all States to do the same. We intend to use our coordinator role of the process involving the Council’s five permanent members (P5) to continue the excellent work that has taken place under Chinese leadership, including continuing the P-5’s dialogue with all signatories. We will remain a strong supporter of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and all the work that it does, including efforts related to technical cooperation.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"The United Kingdom has made significant extrabudgetary contributions to support the refurbishment of the nuclear application laboratories at Seibersdorf, Austria, including in the amount of more than €1 million for the period from 2016 to 2018. We are pleased to have signed a new Voluntary Offer Agreement and Additional Protocol with the IAEA in June 2018 and a Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement in 2018, which enables the United Kingdom to establish a domestic nuclear safeguards regime. We continue to regard the additional protocol as the gold standard of safeguards and urge those States that have yet to do so to agree and ratify such agreements with the IAEA. We strongly support the State-level concept.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"I also want to note the echoing silence on compliance issues from some of the States that are most eager to promote the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, a treaty lacks any concrete provisions for verifying compliance. The United Kingdom will not support, sign or ratify it.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"We should not underestimate the challenges facing the NPT, which are themselves an indication of the challenges facing international security. Any meaningful discussion on disarmament must take the wider security environment into account. We all have a responsibility to work for a safer, more stable world in which States with nuclear weapons feel able to relinquish them. That is where the Security Council must make its own contribution to the NPT. That must involve remaining resolute in our determination to fully disarm North Korea and prevent the escalation of conflicts. We must give our full political support to the continuation of the NPT process and an agreed, consensus-based
outcome of the upcoming Review Conference.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Mr. Ugarelli (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): Peru welcomes the convening of this meeting to focus the world’s attention on the need to address the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, especially nuclear weapons.

"Throughout its history, the Security Council has remained united in the fight against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, in fulfilment of its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security under the Charter of the United Nations. There is no better way to eliminate the risk posed by weapons of mass destruction than by ending their existence. In that regard, we support the preparations leading up to the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), to be held next year.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Peru maintains its firm position in support of the full implementation of the three pillars of the NPT and emphasizes the importance of achieving its universality. We therefore urge the nuclear-weapon States to fulfil their commitments under article VI of the Treaty and make progress towards the total destruction of those weapons, thereby eliminating their effect on humankind. In our understanding of and commitment to that goal, we participated actively in the adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and have signed it. We hope that one day all countries, especially those with nuclear arsenals, will accede to it. In our view, this legally binding instrument strengthens and complements the current disarmament and non-proliferation regimes, particularly as it contributes to the implementation of article VI of the NPT, on the reduction of such weapons.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"In recent years we have observed with concern the challenges that have arisen to the non-proliferation regimes, especially that of nuclear weapons, which pose the most serious threat to international peace and security in our current circumstances. We will continue to seek unity in the Council in our response to such challenges, such as those we have seen in the nuclear and ballistic-missile programmes of the Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Peru affirms the inalienable right of all States to conduct research on, produce and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.

"With respect to nuclear disarmament, it is imperative that we begin negotiations that will lead to a fissile-material cut-off treaty. In that connection, we especially call on nuclear-weapon States to break the deadlock in the Conference on Disarmament with a view to immediately taking up negotiations on a non-discriminatory and verifiable treaty. Similarly, as we look ahead to the tenth NPT Review Conference, we believe that this regime can be strengthened only by reducing the nuclear arsenals that remain, which is why we urge nuclear-weapon States to comply with article VI of the NPT and take concrete measures. Peru hopes to see points of convergence in well-known areas of disagreement. In that regard, we deplore the suspension of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and urge both countries to resume a dialogue with a view to overcoming their differences and achieving agreements based on the principles of irreversibility, verifiability and transparency.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session

"At the outset, we would like to acknowledge the valuable role that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) plays in providing assistance to States for the safe use of nuclear energy for development and peaceful purposes. We are grateful for the strengthened relations between our nation and the IAEA, especially in the implementation of cooperative projects. Through its Ministry of Energy and Mines, the Dominican Republic is currently a partner in two national and 47 regional projects with the IAEA that are in their
completion and implementation stages.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"The Dominican Republic reiterates its firm commitment to the obligations outlined in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and its three fundamental pillars of disarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The full implementation of those three pillars represents the key route to achieving a world free of nuclear weapons and the maintenance of international peace and security.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"We commend the progress that has been made in the framework of non-proliferation, including the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran. Its adoption and continued effective implementation to this day, in spite of setbacks, is a convincing testament to the success that multilateralism and dialogue can achieve. We hope that Iran, the States parties to the agreement and other Member States will refrain from taking steps that undermine the agreement and the confidence placed in it.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"That is why we urge that similar concrete and practical action be taken on disarmament, the pillar of the Treaty that has seen no significant progress. We believe that the only guarantee against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is their complete elimination and prohibition, in a transparent, verifiable and irreversible manner. That is why we became a signatory to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, adopted in July 2017. The Treaty is the logical and necessary result of the deep concern that NPT member States have expressed about the potentially catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons. It also strengthens the NPT and represents an urgent multilateral response to the erosion of bilateral treaties and the threat posed by efforts to modernize nuclear weapons, which could lead to a new nuclear arms race. In that regard, we note with concern the recent suspension of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. We hope that the parties will be able to resume the dialogue and arrive at reasonable conclusions.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"One element that strengthens the non-proliferation and disarmament regime is the establishment of nuclearweapon-free zones. Thanks to our experience of being part of the densely populated area declared as the first nuclear-weapon-free zone through the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, we can confirm that the establishment of such zones brings us closer to achieving general
and complete disarmament and promotes peace and
regional and international stability.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"In that connection, we hope that during the next review of the NPT we will be able to definitively agree on the holding of a conference on a nuclearweapon-free zone in the Middle East, in accordance with what was agreed in the final document of the 2010 Review Conference. We also encourage the States parties to the NPT to keep their commitments, in particular those outlined in article VI of the Treaty, which call for negotiations with a view to general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international supervision.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"We believe that the Comprehensive Nuclear-TestBan Treaty complements the NPT. We therefore call on the annex 2 States to the Treaty that have not yet ratified it to do so for its entry into force. Likewise, the expeditious negotiation of a legally binding, non-discriminatory instrument banning the production of fissile material cannot be postponed.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"In conclusion, we believe it is inconsistent for us to aspire to live in a peaceful world and, at the same time, allow the existence of nuclear weapons. Such weapons pose a threat to collective security, the development of our nations and the environment. Their use runs counter to the principles set out in the Charter of the United Nations and international law.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session

activities regarding other weapons of mass destruction,
for my country firmly champions universal nuclear
disarmament. We have always appealed to the sense
of responsibility of States with nuclear arsenals and
those with military nuclear ambitions or plans — as
the President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea,
Mr. Obiang Nguema Mbasogo has always noted in
speeches on this subject before the General Assembly
and other international forums — to move towards the

"Fifty years after its entry into force, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea underlines the importance of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as the cornerstone of the international non-proliferation regime and the basis for promoting nuclear disarmament and developing nuclear energy for civilian purposes. But the Republic of Equatorial Guinea has never fully endorsed the Treaty’s approach, as it seeks to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons only in countries that have never possessed them and has done little with regard to their elimination in States that are armed to the teeth with such weapons and with the capacity to devastate our planet and turn it into a lifeless wasteland.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session

Through the signing of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, Africa became a nuclear-weapon-free zone. The issue of ensuring non-proliferation is a key issue for Africa, given its concern about the proper management of its uranium reserves. We therefore call upon the Council to regulate the use of uranium from Africa and that of any region declared a nuclear-weapon-free zone, in order to ensure its exclusive use for civilian and peaceful purposes and to promote non-proliferation.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session

"The fiftieth anniversary of the NPT coming in 2020 underscores the importance of adapting that international instrument to our times, which are very different from the Cold War period when it entered into force. We therefore encourage the international community to explore our common ground with a view to rewriting and bringing us closer to the NPT of 2020, which should be different from that of 1970, in that its scope with regard to disarmament and non-proliferation should be applicable generally and equally for all States, and should no longer take into consideration the differences and prerogatives that the NPT has privileged whereby some States are exempt
from some of the international obligations that global
nuclear disarmament requires. That calls into question
the international equality of all States.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"I would like to conclude by making a strong appeal to all nuclear-weapon States that are embroiled in negotiations or that have yet to resolve outstanding issues on the establishment or renewal of non-proliferation agreements to keep going and spare no effort to achieve those agreements.

It would be hard to overestimate its contribution to ensuring international peace and security. The Treaty has played a crucial role in preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and laid the foundation for steady progress towards disarmament, in particular nuclear disarmament, and for the development of broad international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy. It can rightly be considered an example of the effectiveness of international diplomacy and a model of cooperation by the international community in solving global problems. Unfortunately, despite its undeniable successes, we must acknowledge the very difficult circumstances in which we are approaching the Treaty’s fiftieth anniversary and its next Review Conference, which has to sum up the functioning of the Treaty in its latest five-year cycle.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session

norms and mechanisms in the area of non-proliferation
are being undermined or subjected to revision. To
that we have to add the recent emergence of new and
dangerous trends that are heating up an already difficult
situation with regard to nuclear non-proliferation. This
is about attempts to use the NPT review process as a
platform to settle political scores, including on issues
that have nothing to do with the Treaty. Long-standing
differences also persist with regard to a number of
items on the Treaty’s agenda.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session

Last year we reached the levels for delivery systems and warheads established in the New START Treaty. Overall, Russia’s nuclear arsenal has been reduced by more than 85 per cent.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"It is clear that consistent preliminary efforts will be needed to lay the groundwork for future progress towards nuclear disarmament. First and foremost, that requires improving the strategic situation in various regions and in the world as a whole. That can be done only by addressing a whole range of factors that affect strategic stability and international security. They include, specifically, the United States’ completely unrestricted deployment of its global anti-ballistic missile systems; the development of high-precision non-nuclear strategic offensive arms; the possibility that weapons will be launched in outer space; the weakening of the system of international treaties and agreements in the areas of security, stability and arms control; and attempts to weaken the defence capabilities of other countries through illegitimate unilateral sanctions that circumvent the Security Council. If those problems are not solved, we will hardly be able to create an international security environment that is conducive to furthering nuclear disarmament.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"Another pressing issue related to the NPT is the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in the Middle East. General Assembly decision 73/546, adopted in December by a majority of votes, on convening a conference on the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction was intended to begin the process of the practical implementation of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East and thereby make a positive contribution to the general state of affairs in
the context of the NPT review process. The General
Assembly’s decision is logical and balanced and does
not run counter to the interests of the States in the
region. The Russian Federation plans to participate in
the conference on the WMD-free zone and to promote
its successful outcome, as well as support subsequent
efforts to establish the zone. It will be important for the
other five nuclear-weapon States, but most importantly

"We view the IAEA safeguards as a key element of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. Their purpose is to prevent the diversion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy to the creation of nuclear weapons. We are determined to continue to assist the IAEA in strengthening the safeguards system. However, it is vital to ensure that the NPT verification mechanism remains objective, depoliticized and technically based, and to maintain the clarity and transparency of its work for the parties to the Treaty. Russia supports the universalization of the additional protocol to the IAEA safeguards agreements, which, together with the comprehensive safeguards agreement, should eventually become a universally recognized norm for verifying States’ compliance with their non-proliferation obligations under the NPT. At the same time, we note that adherence to the additional protocol is voluntary.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session
"One issue on which there appears to be agreement among the NPT States parties is the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. In accordance with article IV of the Treaty, States parties have an inalienable right to the peaceful use of atomic energy. The current level of technological development makes it possible to combine nuclear power and other types of energy production organically, opening up the prospects for creating more advanced, flexible and efficient energy systems. But as Mr. Amano rightly pointed out, the use of nuclear technologies is not limited to energy but extends to uses in various areas of activity including industry, agriculture, medicine, climate, water use and more. We believe that the NPT significantly expands the possibilities for the use of nuclear power systems for sustainable development while eliminating
risks to the nuclear-weapon non-proliferation regime.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8500,UN Security Council Transcript,8500th Session

Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and its commitments. There
are tangible concerns with regard to the challenges that
burden the NPT today, but I sense a willingness in the
Council to jointly assume responsibility for the future
of the Treaty and for advancing its objectives beyond
2020. This meeting has also contributed to fostering
a better understanding of the different views and
priorities related to the issue within the Security Council
membership, and should help us to find the right way
forward towards a successful Review Conference. I

"(spoke in English) Before giving the floor to our briefers, I would like to make a few short remarks. Today we have chosen a solution-oriented approach that does not focus on a situation in a specific country. The multitude of complex and fragmented conflicts around the world calls for a discussion about what we as States Members of the United Nations can do to counter violence against humanitarian personnel, civilians and medical missions. When we provide humanitarian assistance, it should be demand-driven and based on humanitarian principles, and safeguarding the humanitarian space must be a guiding concern.

"Mr. Lowcock: Though we sometimes forget this, the last 70 years have in fact been relatively peaceful. The late Hans Rosling pointed out that one reason for that is that except for reasons of self-defence, war between States became illegal, thanks to the Charter of the United Nations. But where conflict persists, it is civilians who now bear the brunt. Wars have forced nearly 70 million people to flee their homes. As combatants in recent times have increasingly resorted to siege and starvation as weapons of war, and as conflict has prevented farmers from reaping their harvests, destroyed vital infrastructure and disrupted commercial trade, hunger levels have once again increased after decades of decline. Some 60 per cent of people affected by food crises now live in conflictaffected countries.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Today’s conflicts are marked by more direct attacks on humanitarian workers, and on medical workers and their facilities, than used to be the case. The Aid Worker Security Database reported 317 attacks on aid workers last year, which resulted in 113 deaths. The World Health Organization reported 388 attacks on health personnel or facilities in 2018, resulting in the deaths of more than 300 people and injuries to 400 more. In some places, medical workers also now face criminal prosecution simply for doing their job of treating sick or wounded fighters. Increasingly, we see the deliberate and organized use of rape as a weapon of war. One in five displaced women who are asked say that they have experienced sexual violence. Children are being recruited into armed groups, forced into early marriage or used as suicide bombers. They are being barred from education as their schools are attacked or taken over. The United Nations verified more than 21,000 grave violations of children’s rights in 2017. In towns and
cities, belligerents use explosive weapons designed for
open battlefields, resulting in mass civilian casualties,
enormous destruction of infrastructure and long-term
disruption of essential services. All of these things have
a big impact on humanitarian operations.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"First, protracted conflicts and chronic crises have caused humanitarian needs to spiral. This year, 139 million people are in acute humanitarian need, most of them because of armed conflict. That is three times as many as a decade ago. Combatants deliberately hinder humanitarian operations, slowing them down, driving up costs and blocking aid from reaching the people most in need. Violence against humanitarian workers, including killing, maiming, kidnapping and abduction, also obstructs humanitarian operations.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"International humanitarian law is designed to minimize human suffering in war, including by safeguarding humanitarian activities, and therefore ensuring greater respect for international humanitarian law is one of the most effective ways to safeguard the humanitarian space. This year we mark the seventieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, which are complemented in important ways by their Additional Protocols. Many countries have also signed treaties prohibiting or restricting weapons and enshrining international criminal law. And this year marks the twentieth anniversary of the protection of civilians in the Security Council.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"The Council has taken practical steps to safeguard humanitarian action in the past. The United Nations peace operations mandated by the Security Council support and enable humanitarian access and apply sanctions to those who obstruct it. Resolution 2286 (2016) covers the protection of medical personnel and facilities in armed conflict. We therefore have a strong legal framework for safeguarding humanitarian activity in conflict. The problem is that the fighting parties and their backers do not always follow it, and this has grave consequences. I therefore want to offer proposals in five areas that could generate greater respect for international humanitarian law and safeguard the humanitarian space.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"First, we should promote policies and practices to strengthen adherence to international humanitarian law. That includes endorsing such political commitments as the Safe Schools Declaration or the French declaration on the protection of medical and humanitarian personnel. The Council could seek much
wider endorsement for such commitments. Related
efforts also include developing policy frameworks that
establish the authorities that are responsible for the
protection of civilians, as well as reviewing policies
and practical measures for implementing international
humanitarian law. Examples of that include establishing
civilian-casualty mitigation measures, developing
policies to avoid the use of explosive weapons with
wide-area effects in populated areas and making
arms exports conditional on respect for international
humanitarian law.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Secondly, we should broaden and deepen the understanding and acceptance of existing rules, including the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols. I am sure that Peter Maurer will touch on this point, but experience has shown that fighting parties often have an incomplete understanding of international humanitarian law. Providing training for armed forces and members of non-State armed groups on how to respect humanitarian law can help, and Member States should assist humanitarian organizations in spreading such knowledge.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Thirdly, we should enable humanitarian and medical activities. All parties should adopt clear and simplified procedures to facilitate humanitarian access. They should establish civil-military coordination platforms or humanitarian notification systems to facilitate parties’ respect for humanitarian operations. Council members and other Member States could do more to advocate for rapid and unimpeded access to people in need, including by adopting clear, simple, expedited procedures and by supporting humanitarian organizations to engage with armed groups for humanitarian purposes. States can also take practical measures to minimize the impact of sanctions and counter-terrorism measures on humanitarian action. The Council is about to hear a very important presentation on that by Professor Modirzadeh. In addition, States can adopt measures to protect medical care, in line with the SecretaryGeneral’s recommendations on resolution 2286 (2016). Those recommendations include, for example, ensuring legal protection for medical personnel when they are acting in line with medical ethics and adopting preventative measures to minimize the impact of hostilities on medical care.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Fourthly, with regard to compliance, States and the Security Council could promote the universalization of international humanitarian law and human rights treaties. The right kinds of incentives and penalties can
boost compliance. For example, sanctions imposed by
the Security Council can be a powerful tool to promote
compliance and States can exert their diplomatic,
political and economic influence over parties to a
conflict in order to strengthen compliance.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Finally, regarding accountability, States certainly need to do much better in holding individuals to account when they commit serious violations of international humanitarian law. For example, by adopting legislation that encompasses the full range of international crimes and jurisdiction over them and by strengthening the national capacity to carry out impartial, independent investigations into allegations of war crimes and, crucially, to prosecute suspects when the evidence justifies such a step. Where national accountability systems are insufficient, there should be more support for international or hybrid accountability mechanisms, including the International Criminal Court. Supporting, financially or otherwise, the systematic collection, analysis and documentation of evidence of violations of international humanitarian law is very important as part of that process.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Lastly, let us never forget that accountability for serious violations of international humanitarian law is required by law",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
The President: I thank Mr. Lowcock for his briefing. I now give the floor to Mr. Maurer.,No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Mr. Maurer: I am grateful for the opportunity to address the Security Council today. The shape of conflict has undergone rapid transformation in recent years and the result is a heavy price being paid by tens of millions of women, men and children around the world. They suffer the immediate impact, namely, death, injury and displacement, and often the invisible harms, such as psychological trauma, sexual violence and the loss of missing family members. In today’s wars, a vast array of armed forces, special forces, armed groups, terrorist groups and criminal gangs now fight directly or by proxy and openly or secretly. Conflicts and protagonists cross State borders. Battles are fought in populated areas, risking thousands of civilian lives and destroying critical infrastructure. Wars often involve partners and allies, leading to a dilution of responsibility, the fragmentation of command chains and an unchecked flow of weapons. That only increases the climate of
impunity and, ultimately, causes yet more suffering.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"With the absence of political solutions, wars are increasingly protracted, with year after year of violence and turmoil, embedding resentments and deepening fragility. When I speak with families who are living through the realities of war and violence today, they often asked why this has happened and how this has been allowed to happen. Humanitarian action is often desperately needed in such miserable situations.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Throughout the operations of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), we see that neutral, independent and impartial humanitarian action has the best chance of reaching those most in need. It is also a tried and tested formula to prevent humanitarian action being appropriated for larger and more controversial political agendas.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Yet in many places across the world, the space for impartial humanitarian action is under threat. Human dignity is disregarded, the applicability of the law is questioned, and humanitarian aid is politicized and deliberately hijacked for political gain or the control of populations. Terrorist attacks, indiscriminate by nature, are destroying the very notion of proportionality, precaution and distinction, which are at the core of behaviour in combat.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Moreover, neutral and impartial humanitarian action is hindered by complex sanctions regimes and counter-terrorism measures. Humanitarian organizations are increasingly placed under pressure as both States and non-State armed groups hold civilian populations and humanitarian actors to ransom in order to achieve their goals.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"But humanitarian organizations do not exist to endorse, to legitimize or to help the authorities further their political objectives. The ICRC works to help States live up to the obligations to which they have signed up, not to help them circumnavigate them. When the principles of impartiality are breached and humanitarian action is curtailed, families such as the ones I meet go hungry, fall sick and are left vulnerable to abuse. It is no wonder that they are asking why.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Today we are also witnessing a shift in the perception of international humanitarian law and protection work. International humanitarian law does not rely on reciprocity. It applies even if an opponent fails to comply. It relies on a consensual understanding among belligerents that there are limits to war and that
there must be a neutral and impartial humanitarian
space in which those not participating in hostilities
are protected. Those who deny the space deny the very
essence of the law.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"The Geneva Conventions are not up for negotiation. They reflect, in normative language, the tested practice of societies over time. They are customary law and must guide practical action. They are a tool and a reliable basis on which to facilitate trust and dialogue, allowing for consensus-building among belligerents. For example, agreements have been brokered with regard to those who have gone missing during war, bringing news to traumatized families on each side, or exchanging the remains of the dead. Such agreements, facilitated throughout a neutral and independent space, can be the first steps in building trust and in forming other arrangements to lessen people’s suffering, such as the exchange of detainees, family contacts across front lines and others.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"With political actors increasingly occupying the humanitarian space, humanitarians must find practical ways to fulfil our mission in today’s more complex environment. Front-line humanitarian negotiators are rapidly becoming more critical in building support for humanitarian action. Through the Centre of Competence on Humanitarian Negotiation, the ICRC has been building systematic knowledge and networks of professional negotiators to develop more adaptive strategies and practices in field operations today.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"It is the task of the international community to fiercely defend and protect principled humanitarian action. We ask that States take the following very practical steps, that is, that they fight any attempt to instrumentalize, manipulate or politicize principled humanitarian action. Humanitarian access must not be unlawfully denied or withheld, especially when people’s basic needs are going unmet. While neutral and impartial organizations, such as the ICRC, in accordance with the Geneva Conventions, have the right to propose humanitarian action to States, States have an obligation to facilitate such action unless constrained by valid security concerns.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"We ask that States fight the double standards that delegitimize law and weaken its protective force. Politics is about the different priorities of States, and we well understand how difficult it is in today’s international arena to harmonize their positions. The humanitarian space is about respecting the law to which they have
already agreed consensually, not about abusing the
law to make a political point. We ask, therefore, that
States lead by example and steadfastly respect their
obligations under international humanitarian law.
Individually or in partnered military operations,
this means using their positive influence to ensure
the proper application of the rules on the conduct of
hostilities, the protection of civilians and medical
facilities, and the humane treatment of detainees. We
ask that States train and instruct their own troops and
the troops of their partners so that they know the law
and how to respect it, that they vet and oversee with
appropriate structures, processes and mechanisms the
combat operations in which they and their partners
are involved, and that they put in place accountability
mechanisms that ensure respect for the law.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"With regard to the proliferation of arms, we urge that States ensure that safeguards and precautions are in place and that no weapon is transferred if there is a clear risk that it would be used to violate international humanitarian law. We ask that hostilities be conducted in a manner that protects civilians and with respect for the basic principles of distinction, precaution and proportionality and that their operational guidance and those of their partners concretize these principles for combat operations. Of particular concern is the use of explosive weapons. The ICRC sees the enormous civilian cost of bombing and shelling, including death and physical injury, but also long-term damage to critical civilian infrastructure.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"We ask all parties to an armed conflict to refrain from using explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated areas owing to the significant likelihood of indiscriminate effects. To support these efforts of leadership on international humanitarian law, the ICRC is preparing an international humanitarian law road map, to be adopted at the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent in November. We are looking forward to working with States and national societies on pledges for the respect and implementation of international humanitarian law.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"The noose is tightening on humanitarian action. We have seen some positive steps, including consistent increases in humanitarian funding levels and the recognition that counter-terrorism measures must be compliant with international humanitarian law obligations. The recent resolution 2462 (2019) is a case in point. Its implementation at the domestic level will be a crucial step towards preserving a humanitarian
space in domestic counter-terrorism regulations.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"But our license to operate should not be up for debate. It has already been guaranteed. The mission to protect and aid civilians during times of armed conflict was universally agreed 70 years ago, in the Geneva Conventions. We call on States to step forward and reaffirm this mission, not only in words but through urgent and concrete actions.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
The President: I now give the floor to Ms. Modirzadeh.,No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Ms. Modirzadeh: I appreciate the opportunity to share some of my reflections on the intersections between international humanitarian law and counterterrorism measures. My primary objective here is to raise key considerations to help inform this afternoon’s discussion. I will focus on the importance of ensuring that counter-terrorism measures, including measures adopted by the Security Council, do not inhibit the principled humanitarian action foreseen in, or required by, international humanitarian law. I will also focus on steps that the Council can take to further safeguard humanitarian action and strengthen compliance with international humanitarian law.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"In short, I am concerned that counter-terrorism measures may be interpreted and applied in ways that might ultimately diminish commitments to principled humanitarian action. I urge the Council to build on a recently adopted resolution by taking more robust and more concrete steps to ensure implementation of the extensive and vital international humanitarian law protections for principled humanitarian action. In this regard, settings where counter-terrorism measures may overlap with situations of armed conflict warrant particular attention",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"The common story about the relationships between counter-terrorism frameworks and international humanitarian law presents these regimes as sharing a unitary purpose. This story tells us that these frameworks are alternative sets of norms created to solve the same problems. Under this narrative, which I believe misapprehends the fundamental purposes of these frameworks, any divergences between these regimes can be managed merely by technical or legal solutions. I ask the Council to consider an alternative approach — namely, that the challenges that I discuss here may require political solutions crafted by Member States. Let me explain.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"International humanitarian law is a body of treaty and customary rules, drafted and ratified over the course of more than a century. States have developed international humanitarian law as the primary legal framework designed to regulate the exceptional situation of armed conflict. Under international humanitarian law, some forms of violence, irrespective of who undertakes them or for what purposes they are undertaken, are not unlawful in themselves so long as the conduct comports with the applicable rules. International humanitarian law regulates means and methods of warfare in respect of all parties to armed conflict. It also permits — and even demands — that principled humanitarian action be undertaken in armed conflict. These rules are designed, first and foremost, to protect civilians and other non-combatants.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"In comparison, counter-terrorism measures aim to prevent, suppress and punish acts characterized as terrorism. Building on sectoral conventions and regional treaties, since 2001 the Security Council has taken the lead in regulating terrorism globally. But that is only part of the picture. As several recent reports have detailed, the increasingly complex web of counterterrorism measures encompasses an ever-growing range of laws, policies and prevention initiatives. This framework contrasts with the relatively narrow and specific purview of international humanitarian law.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"When these two regimes come into contact with one another, tensions may emerge between them. For instance, international humanitarian law foresees that humanitarian actors may provide impartial medical care to wounded fighters hors de combat as well as provide life-saving goods and services to civilian populations under the de facto control of non-State parties to armed conflict. Yet under several counter-terrorism frameworks, these same activities are characterized as illegitimate and unlawful.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Where principled humanitarian action is considered to constitute a type of illegitimate support for terrorism, counter-terrorism measures may inhibit, or even impede, the work of humanitarian actors in wide-ranging and consequential ways.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Those actors may thus experience difficulties in providing relief and protection in line with humanitarian principles. Humanitarian actors may become understandably wary of engaging in conduct that they believe can expose them to legal liability, and they might accordingly limit or halt their operations. Nevertheless, to maintain operations where needs are
greatest, humanitarian actors have taken diverse steps
and invested extensive resources in seeking to comply
with counter-terrorism requirements while adhering to
humanitarian principles.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"For their part, researchers have gathered evidence of the impact of counter-terrorism measures. For example, in 2017 the Harvard Law School Program on International Law and Armed Conflict carried out a pilot empirical survey study. The study represented an initial attempt to gather concrete data regarding these matters. Sixty-nine per cent of survey respondents indicated that counter-terrorism measures had curtailed their work. In my view, the question is not whether counter-terrorism measures might adversely affect principled humanitarian action, but the scope and scale of that impact.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Alongside other bodies, the Security Council itself has increasingly recognized some of these possibilities and the imperative to safeguard principled humanitarian action in counter-terrorism contexts. For example, in 2010 the Council established a limited sectoral humanitarian exemption in relation to the Somalia sanctions regime. The General Assembly, in the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy Review — first in 2016 and again in 2018 — urged States to guard against counterterrorism risks to humanitarian and medical activities.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Furthermore, four days ago, the Security Council adopted resolution 2462 (2019), on counterterrorism financing. That resolution directs Member States to ensure that their domestic laws and regulations establish “serious criminal offenses” related to the provision of certain kinds of financial support to terrorist organizations or individual terrorists. The resolution also demands that Member States ensure that all measures taken to counter terrorism comply with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"On the one hand, the adoption of the resolution reaffirms the Council’s commitment to the centrality of international humanitarian law as a matter of international peace and security. Yet, on the other hand, the Council is in a position to do much more. For example, consider the generic references by the Council to complying with international humanitarian law and other applicable rules of international law while combating terrorism. While important in principle, those references do not sufficiently comprehend and address the diverse and consequential ways that counterterrorism measures and international humanitarian law
protections for principled humanitarian action may
conflict in practice.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"In conclusion, I wish to urge the Security Council to expand upon and prioritize its efforts to safeguard principled humanitarian action. As the many Government officials and policymakers in the Chamber today will know from first-hand experience, counterterrorism measures may prove very difficult to amend once they have been instituted. Any tension with the agreed norms of international humanitarian law should be of urgent concern to the Council. Consequently, it is imperative to ensure that counter-terrorism measures at all levels are crafted and implemented in ways that respect principled humanitarian action and do not degrade it. I therefore urge the Council to take several steps.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"First, the Council may wish to guard against overly broad and vague notions of what constitutes unlawful support to terrorism, including in its own practice concerning designated individuals and entities.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Secondly, the Council and its subsidiary bodies may wish to ensure that none of the activities that underlie principled humanitarian action form part or all of the basis for subjecting individuals or entities to sanctions or other restrictive regimes.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Thirdly, the Council may wish to urgently consider comprehensive exemptions for principled humanitarian action that are grounded in a steadfast commitment to international humanitarian law.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Fourthly, and above all, the Council may wish to uphold and ensure respect for hard-won legal protections for principled humanitarian action amid the tumult of war. Far too much is at stake for the millions of people suffering in armed conflict for it to pursue anything else.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
The President: I thank Ms. Modirzadeh for her briefing. I shall now give the floor to the members of the Council who wish to make statements.

"Sheikh Al Sabah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): Allow me to begin, Mr. President, by congratulating you and the Federal Republic of Germany on assuming the presidency of the Security Council for the month
of April. I would also like to congratulate and thank
His Excellency Mr. Jean-Yves Le Drian and the
friendly Republic of France for the able stewardship
of the Council in March. I also thank today’s
briefers — Mr. Peter Maurer, Mr. Mark Lowcock and
Ms. Naz Modirzadeh — for their comprehensive and
enlightening briefings on what could be considered one
of the most important current issues, namely, promoting
the rule of law and providing humanitarian protection
in line with international humanitarian law.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"As members know, the year 2019 marks the seventieth anniversary of the 1949 Geneva Conventions. In the light of the current international situation, with ongoing armed conflicts in several regions of the world, the issue of promoting the rule of law, in particular international humanitarian law, has become more important than ever before. The four Geneva Conventions and their Protocols Additional thereto provide the legal framework for humanitarian protection in wars and armed conflicts. However, it is also important to realize that, although the Conventions have been universally ratified, regrettably they are not adhered to or respected as required. The world has continued to witness neglect and blatant disregard concerning the texts of those Conventions in recent times.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Amid fighting and bloodshed, which have regrettably become the headlines of many of today’s conflicts, we are witnessing record levels of humanitarian suffering. As we heard earlier in the briefing made on behalf of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, international humanitarian needs have reached record levels. For example, as we meet today, more than 130 million people throughout the world are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"The Israeli occupation of the Arab territories, including Palestinian land, which has lasted for more than five decades, is considered a blatant violation of international norms and conventions. Israel’s practices and policies are a blatant violation of international law. They include the expansion of existing settlements and an unprecedented level of construction of new ones. Such prolonged occupation has had a permanent negative impact on the daily lives of the Palestinian people for decades, in violation of the principles of international law and the relevant Security Council resolutions. That was clearly stated in the conclusions of the independent international commission of inquiry on the protests in the occupied Palestinian territory, which found that
Israeli soldiers committed violations of international
humanitarian law and international human rights law
during the demonstrations in connection with the Great
March of Return. As confirmed by the commission,
some of those violations are tantamount to war crimes
and crimes against humanity.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"In Syria, where the crisis is entering its ninth year, we have witnessed the most reprehensible violations of international humanitarian law, through the continued and deliberate targeting of civilians and their property, as well as public facilities. Moreover, we have witnessed the ongoing obstruction of the efforts of humanitarian agencies and organizations delivering aid to those who need it regularly. How can we end those violations and alleviate the considerable humanitarian suffering in conflict areas? The answer to that question is the essence of today’s discussion, namely, we need to promote the rule of law and respect humanitarian principles during armed conflict. However, the more important question is, how will we achieve that?",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"First of all, the United Nations, in general, and the Security Council, in particular, have an important and pivotal role to play in guaranteeing adherence to international humanitarian law and in promoting the rule of law. That is accomplished by ensuring the full implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions, especially in the context of protecting civilians in armed conflict, and by adherence to international humanitarian law on the part of parties to a conflict and the international organizations working on the ground. Moreover, United Nations peacekeeping forces have a responsibility to protect civilians by taking the necessary measures to guarantee such protection within their mandated tasks for camps of internally displaced persons and ensure medical evacuation for the wounded, as well as strengthening the capabilities of national police forces to enable them to perform their duties.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"The perilous security environment in which some United Nations forces operate may require that they use force in self-defence. It is therefore important for United Nations forces to abide by all the relevant international rules, including international humanitarian law where applicable. Furthermore, parties to a conflict and international organizations working in the field must respect international humanitarian law. It is also important to guarantee accountability for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. We must condemn all human rights violations by any party to
conflict and ensure that those who target civilians in
any way are held accountable. Unfortunately, impunity
is one of the main features of today’s conflicts,
which has served to encourage the commission of
the most blatant violations of every basic principle of
international humanitarian law, international human
rights law and the relevant General Assembly and
Security Council resolutions.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"We nevertheless commend the efforts of the General Assembly and the Security Council in adopting the measures necessary to ensure accountability with regard to many of the items on the Security Council’s agenda, including the establishment of the Impartial and Independent Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation and Prosecution of Persons Responsible for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law Committed in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011. The State of Kuwait was one of the sponsors of General Assembly resolution 71/248, which established the Mechanism. We also support the establishment of an independent mechanism to hold accountable those who have committed crimes against the Muslim Rohingya minority in Myanmar. In addition, we commend the unanimous adoption by the Security Council of resolution 2379 (2017), which calls for the establishment of an independent team to investigate the crimes perpetrated by the group known as Da’esh and hold it accountable for the heinous acts it committed in Iraq. Those and similar mechanisms are important to guarantee an end to impunity. Ensuring accountability and prosecuting persons having violated human rights and international humanitarian law are key to achieving sustainable peace.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"This morning’s discussions at the Arria Formula meeting on the protection of humanitarian and medical personnel, which you convened, Mr. President, demonstrate the importance of adhering to international law. As Member States, we shoulder the responsibility of implementing them more comprehensively by adopting specific and pragmatic measures, including the exchange of expertise and best practices among States and the coordination of efforts in terms of adhering to international humanitarian law. In that regard, we note that the State of Kuwait supports the political declaration proposed by the Republic of France on the protection of medical personnel in conflict zones.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session

"The Charter of the United Nations aims “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind”. Unfortunately today, seven decades after its signing, the scourge of war continues to cause sadness and sorrow throughout many of the world’s societies and States.

"Mr. Le Drian (France) (spoke in French): First of all, I to express to you, Sir, my support for the German presidency, wish it every success and underscore the powerful, as well as operational, symbolism represented by the consecutive French and German presidencies. For together with our friend Mr. Heiko Maas, we wanted for the Security Council to act so as to safeguard what we refer to as humanitarian space, or the ability of humanitarian workers to carry out their work safely and effectively in accordance with the principles of impartiality, flexibility and independence.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"The first condition necessary for ensuring the sustainability of that space is respect for international humanitarian law. The 1949 Geneva Conventions, whose seventieth anniversary we will commemorate on 12 August, bear the mark of the history of our two countries — France and Germany — and the tragedies that have punctuated our shared history and that of our continent. As Mr. Maurer, President of the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), mentioned earlier,
the Geneva Conventions and their Protocols Additional,
of which we call for the universal ratification, are today
violated in many conflicts. Certain parties go so far
as to intentionally integrate their violation into their
military strategies. Humanitarian workers and medical
infrastructure are being deliberately attacked to deprive
people of any relief and to secure their surrender. That
was the topic of the Arria Formula meeting that we
convened this morning. We are also witnessing the use
of starvation and sexual violence as weapons of war,
as well as the recruitment of child soldiers, which is
intended to achieve the same goal — to win faster by
maximizing the human cost of the conflict.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Improved compliance with international humanitarian law requires in particular three types of action to which the Security Council can contribute: first, ensuring access for humanitarian aid to populations in need; secondly, developing preventive measures; and, lastly, combating impunity.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"First, humanitarian personnel must have access to civilians, which means that they must be protected from all forms of violence and threats. It is unacceptable that in South Sudan and the Central African Republic, for example, humanitarian workers and aid convoys are targeted. We must also take measures to ensure that humanitarian personnel are not unduly prosecuted for activities conducted in strict compliance with humanitarian principles. That is a key element with regard to the credibility of our collective commitment to combating terrorism.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Secondly, the Council shoulders the responsibility for preventing violations of international humanitarian law. That is what we do when we place the protection of civilians, including women and children, at the core of peacekeeping missions, such as the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali and the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic. Sanctions are a deterrent tool that must be used more systematically against violations of international humanitarian law, in particular against those responsible for sexual violence. Moreover, France stands particularly ready to make attacks against humanitarian personnel a designation criterion in sanctions regimes, such as is now the case concerning
the Central African Republic.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"I had an opportunity to remind the Council of the imperative of protecting children associated with armed forces and groups. I am pleased that the Dominican Republic and Djibouti have endorsed the Paris Principles and the Paris Commitments since the call for their universalization at the open debate of the Security Council in October 2017 (see S/PV.8082). The Security Council must also ensure that the non-United Nations forces it supports conduct their operations in strict compliance with international humanitarian law, which, for example, is made possible by the human rights compliance framework of the Joint Force of the Group of Five for the Sahel, which the Security Council has supported with the goal of limiting the impact of the Force’s operations on civilians.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"It is also up to States to lead the way. With regard to France, international humanitarian law is the rule of conduct for all its operations, and it is integrated as soon as the planning phase, as currently illustrated by Operation Barkhane in the Sahel, where we maintain close dialogue with the ICRC. International humanitarian law is an integral part of our security and defence cooperation, in particular through the training provided to military and civilian staff in national regional schools in Africa, including in conjunction with the ICRC.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session

"Thirdly, let me address the fight against impunity. We must do everything we can to strengthen national capacities and ensure systematic, impartial and independent investigations and, where national mechanisms are insufficient or inadequate, support the use of international mechanisms.

Serious Crimes under International Law Committed
in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011, led to
the arrest in February of three former members of the
Syrian intelligence services, as part of a Franco-German
investigation, and the issuance of international arrest
warrants against senior officials of the repressive
Syrian apparatus. It must be possible to systematize
that type of cooperation.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session

"Today’s meeting is of particular importance for Poland. Poland has pursued its membership in the Security Council with three main priorities — first, strengthening international law; secondly, promoting the protection of civilians in armed conflict; and, thirdly, advocating for the peaceful settlement of disputes. Poland had the privilege of presiding over the Security Council’s work in May of last year. We organized two high-level open debates — on upholding international law within the context of the maintenance of international peace and security (see S/PV.8262) and on the protection of civilians in armed conflicts (S/PV.8264). Both debates focused on international
humanitarian law.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Today’s briefing constitutes the continuation of the Council’s efforts to talk about the situation of those affected by conflicts and work out ways to relieve their suffering. Allow me to share a few comments regarding my country’s perspective on three challenges for international humanitarian law — implementation, development and partnership",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"First, Poland strongly supports the implementation of international humanitarian law, in particular regarding the strengthening of the protection of civilians. The goal of minimizing the suffering of the victims of wars and conflicts cannot be reached without safeguarding humanitarian aid. International humanitarian law serves those who are affected by atrocities. It must also be an effective tool for those who provide humanitarian assistance. For that reason, we decided to join the political declaration on the protection of humanitarian and health workers in conflict. We will continue our efforts to enhance the protection of humanitarian and medical personnel.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"As we all know, international humanitarian law is one of the areas of international public law with the greatest number of multilateral treaties. The great codifications that emerged in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in the form of The Hague and Geneva Conventions were among the most significant law-making initiatives in modern international law. It is said that each new Geneva convention appears one war too late. Newer and newer conflicts proved that there were a number of gaps and inconsistencies relating to the Conventions, which forced a natural regulatory reflex — the need to engage in codification efforts after the end of each conflict to amend and supplement existing treaty regulations.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"While respecting the heritage of treaties, we need to think progressively. For example, the Kigali Principles on the Protection of Civilians have set out a framework for all Member States to improve the capacity of peace operations to protect civilians and could be considered a code of conduct to be followed by all involved in peacekeeping operations.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"We believe that a comprehensive awareness of basic rules flowing from international humanitarian law, such as the protection of civilians in armed conflicts, should be spread among all State and non-State actors. Awareness-raising activities in that regard are therefore essential at both the national and international levels.
Activities in the areas of education, training and media,
including social media, are particularly important in
today’s world.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Secondly, when it comes to the development of international humanitarian law, Poland is strongly committed to the strengthening of international humanitarian law, as reflected in our activities. Since the beginning of the intergovernmental process to strengthen respect for international humanitarian law eight years ago, Poland has supported the establishment of a stand-alone forum of States to enable a discussion on international humanitarian law on a regular basis and the sharing of best practices among States in its implementation and dissemination. Despite the commitment of numerous States, consensus on that new international humanitarian law compliance mechanism has not been reached. We call on all States to support that initiative.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Thirdly, close cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) provides a good example of partnership in the service of international humanitarian law. Poland signed a memorandum of understanding with the ICRC in the area of humanitarian assistance and international humanitarian law. At the national level, we have been engaged in a partnership with the Polish Red Cross, including in the field of education. Every year, Polish authorities organize a five-day annual course with the Polish school of international humanitarian law. The course is intended for different groups of recipients — students, professional commissioned officers and members and volunteers of the Polish Red Cross and other non-governmental organizations. The Professor Remigiusz Bierzanek competition, another Polish initiative, grants awards to the best papers on international humanitarian law and provides students and graduates in law, international relations and similar disciplines an opportunity to present their work to a wider community of specialists. And, next June, we will organize the Warsaw Humanitarian Expo 2019. We hope to have all stakeholders on board while coordinating efforts with a view to achieving the worldwide observation of humanitarian law. The Expo’s Humanitarian City will be a platform for representatives of non-governmental organizations, international institutions and academia to explore issues related to the legal obligations of humanitarian actors.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session

"At present the international and regional security landscape remains grim. Armed conflicts persist in various regions, with civilians bearing the brunt as the chief victims. It is therefore very important to ensure compliance with international humanitarian law, especially with regard to the protection of civilians in armed conflict. In that connection, the existing provisions of international humanitarian law, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions and their two Additional Protocols of 1977, are sufficient. The international community has maintained a strong focus on them and has abided by them. That said, the implementation of international humanitarian law is still fraught with multiple challenges, and today I would like to focus on the following points.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"First, we must stay committed to resolving disputes through peaceful means and addressing the protection of civilians at the source of the problems. The fundamental purpose of compliance with international humanitarian law is to ensure the protection of civilians, and effectively preventing armed conflict represents the best possible protection for civilians. The Security Council should actively encourage preventive diplomacy and political mediation in order to promote the use of peaceful means, such as dialogue and negotiations, to overcome differences among the parties, with a view to seeking political solutions while preventing and de-escalating tensions, thereby protecting civilians from the scourge of war.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Secondly, we must abide by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, as well as the guiding principles for United Nations humanitarian
assistance. No country should use humanitarian
pretexts to undermine another’s sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity. When carrying
out humanitarian relief operations, it is crucial to
follow the principles of humanity, justice, neutrality
and independence, emphasize the humanitarian
character and professionalism of such efforts and
avoid being drawn into a conflict or interfering in the
domestic affairs of the countries concerned. China
commends the International Committee of the Red
Cross for its conduct. All humanitarian agencies should
work to observe international humanitarian law and
related principles effectively and refrain from using
the delivery of humanitarian assistance for political,
military or other purposes.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Thirdly, the international community should work in concert to promote and strengthen international humanitarian law. Governments bear the primary responsibility for protecting their own civilians, and the international community should provide constructive assistance only at the request of the countries concerned. All parties to a conflict should understand and abide by international humanitarian law, implement Council resolutions on the protection of civilians in armed conflict, fulfil their obligations to protect civilians and ensure humanitarian access. United Nations peacekeeping operations should make greater efforts to promote and publicize international humanitarian law and Security Council resolutions, and the Council should work on preventing sanctions from adversely affecting humanitarian relief operations.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Fourthly, the Governments of the States concerned and the parties to a conflict have a duty to protect the safety and security of medical personnel and facilities. Medical personnel and humanitarian workers who risk their lives to deliver life-saving goods and services are the people who make humanitarian operations possible, and the Governments concerned should take effective measures to strengthen their protection of such personnel and facilities. All the parties to a conflict should abide by international humanitarian law and fulfil their obligations to protect medical personnel and facilities. In the event of attacks, threats or acts of violence against medical personnel and facilities in armed conflict, the countries concerned should conduct investigations with a view to bringing the perpetrators to justice in accordance with the law. The international community should provide support and assistance on a
basis of full consultations with the countries concerned.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"As an important participant in and contributor to the international humanitarian law regime, China has played an active role in international humanitarian relief efforts led by the United Nations and has scaled up its assistance every year to the extent it is able. We have continually formulated and refined the relevant regulations in the various mechanisms for implementing the provisions of international humanitarian law. China’s naval escort squadrons have cooperated with many countries in carrying out international humanitarian relief activities. We attach importance to strengthening cooperation on humanitarian assistance with United Nations agencies and civil-society organizations and stand ready to continue to play a constructive role in that field.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Mr. Kuzmin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We welcome you, Sir, and Germany, in your capacity as President of the Council, and we thank France for a very productive presidency in March.

"The formulation of a body of rules relating to international humanitarian law is one of the major accomplishments of the twentieth century. Humanity, including in armed conflict — indeed, on the battlefield — is a hallmark of civilized behaviour. Unfortunately, in the almost 74 years since the end of the Second World War, the Security Council has had to address the issue of strengthening the institutions of international humanitarian law again and again. It is our job to make sure that the authority of international humanitarian law is not undermined, and in order to do that it is essential to refrain from adopting selective approaches or double standards in which some parties’ violations are flagged and the crimes of others are passed over in silence. Incidentally, the President of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) addressed that issue very eloquently.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"It is also our job to work to constantly strengthen the existing mechanisms in the area of international humanitarian law. We believe there are enough of them at present. That was also confirmed by the outcomes issued two weeks ago, on 15 March, of the intergovernmental process on strengthening compliance with international humanitarian law based on the resolution on the subject adopted at the thirty-second Conference of the ICRC. We believe that the problems
with implementation that we are always hearing about
are not because international humanitarian law is weak
but because people are not prepared to put its principles
and standards into practice.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Against a background of persistent armed conflicts, humanitarian assistance is of primary importance, and protecting humanitarian and medical personnel is one of the most crucial aspects of the issue of the protection of civilians. Every party to a conflict is responsible for their safety. Russia will continue to urge the parties to conflicts to take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of providers of humanitarian and medical assistance.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"However, we should point out that we should exercise great precision and caution in discussing the many proposals for involving the Security Council in the architecture of ensuring that the perpetrators of international humanitarian law violations are brought to justice. A number of States have shown recently that they are less and less interested in the reliability of data determining the identity of perpetrators of various evil deeds of one kind or another. What they are interested in is something else entirely.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"One of the main prerequisites for the effective protection of workers from humanitarian organizations and medical personnel is their compliance with the guiding principles of international humanitarian assistance, including respect for sovereignty and the humanitarian, impartial and neutral nature of their provision of humanitarian assistance. Medical and humanitarian workers in areas of conflict must abide by the laws of the country they are in. That is a fundamental truth. It is unacceptable for medical and humanitarian organizations to openly provide assistance to terrorists and carry out their inhumane plans, as the White Helmets are doing in Syria. Such pseudo-humanitarian activities, which amount to a manipulation of the topic of medical and humanitarian assistance in armed conflict, will end up undermining the systems of international humanitarian law and will backfire by damaging the authority of genuine humanitarian and medical workers.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Last week, when the Security Council was working on the draft of resolution 2462 (2019) on combating the financing of terrorism — which, incidentally, has produced a big response — one of the main issues discussed was that of ensuring unhindered access for humanitarian organizations and the provision of
medical care in areas of armed conflict and counterterrorist activity. Through concerted efforts the Council
found a balanced way to word it. Protection, according
to paragraph 24 of the resolution, is to be given to
“exclusively humanitarian activities, including
medical activities, that are carried out by impartial
humanitarian actors in a manner consistent with
international humanitarian law”.
By the way, we are very grateful to the International
Committee of the Red Cross for drawing attention to
this whole issue and for its contribution to the process.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Mr. Esono Mbengono (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in Spanish): At the outset, I would like to congratulate France on its impeccable leadership of the Security Council for the month of March. We wish Germany every success in April, and I would like to thank both delegations for organizing this important briefing. We also welcome the presence of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Kuwait and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Germany, France and Poland, and acknowledge and appreciate the important briefings by Mr. Maurer, Mr. Lowcock, and Professor Modirzadeh.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"The Republic of Equatorial Guinea notes with concern the increasing complexity of armed conflicts and the growing challenge they pose to civilians and to humanitarian assistance for the 139 million people who need it. We thoroughly deplore the persistence of armed conflicts in which civilians are always the worst affected. In that regard, we condemn the attacks on the most vulnerable population groups — children, young people, women, the disabled, refugees and displaced persons. We are also outraged by the increasing attacks on health workers and their facilities.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"International humanitarian law recognizes the principle of State sovereignty, which Equatorial Guinea supports. States should play the leading role in providing relief to communities and individuals under their jurisdiction. However, if for any reason their ability to do so is constrained, they can ensure that those affected by the crisis have access to protection and assistance through international humanitarian aid. Respect for international humanitarian law should not necessarily imply a lack of respect for State sovereignty. On the contrary, the two concepts should be perfectly compatible. International humanitarian law and humanitarian principles are clear in that regard. For that reason, Equatorial Guinea urges the parties to
ongoing armed conflicts to comply with international
humanitarian law, including the 1949 Geneva
Conventions and their two Additional Protocols of 1977,
in order to prevent and limit devastating humanitarian
situations, the escalation of armed conflicts and
the radicalization of their victims, especially young
people. In that regard, we call on humanitarian actors
to respect the guiding principles of international
humanitarian assistance so that they are perceived as
neutral, independent and impartial service providers,
particularly in politically controversial environments.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"At the global level, there has been significant progress in the promotion of international humanitarian law and humanitarian principles. The Security Council has embedded humanitarian principles in several resolutions on armed conflict and starvation, children and armed conflict, Ebоlа in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the prevention and combating of the financing of terrorism, among others that Equatorial Guinea is honoured to have supported. The protection of civilians in armed conflict is also integrated into the mandates of many peacekeeping missions and the training of forces participating in them. The SecretaryGeneral’s reports on children and the protection of civilians in armed conflict and their corresponding lists are helping to generate greater awareness, traction and results. That is still not enough, however, because armed conflicts continue and their natures change.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Among the most serious challenges to the promotion of international humanitarian law today, three stand out — the politicization of humanitarian activities, the resulting lack of trust in humanitarian organizations and the unidirectional approach to this important task. Humanitarian activities are politicized when there is political pressure on humanitarian organizations and States with regard to the financing and use of humanitarian assistance and, in certain cases, some counter-terrorism measures, owing to the growing nexus between terrorism, armed conflicts and transnational organized crime. As a result, national authorities and non-State armed actors distrust humanitarian assistance and its agents, and increasingly resist the presence of certain humanitarian actors, which leads to the imposition and exploitation of restrictions on humanitarian activity",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"The unidirectional approach to promoting respect for international humanitarian law in all regions and States limits their ownership. It is important to remember that concepts similar to international
humanitarian law and many of its principles already
exist in many cultures. In Africa, there are Somali
war conventions and Fulani customs, among others,
that are part of African customary humanitarian law,
as described by legal scholars such as Yolande Diallo
and Emmanuel Bello, among others. In that connection,
efforts to promote, adhere to and ensure compliance
with international humanitarian law could be more
effective if we built on existing analogous principles
in order to encourage their ownership, recognition
and defence by local groups. Greater participation and
representation on the part of all regions and States in
developing and implementing that agenda is important.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"In that regard, we also encourage support for the implementation of African initiatives in that field such as the 2009 African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa, the work of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union and the African Union Peace and Security Strategy. We recognize and encourage the increasingly important United Nations-African Union Joint Task Force on Peace and Security as well as the collaboration between the International Committee of the Red Cross and such non-governmental organizations as African Humanitarian Action.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Equatorial Guinea reaffirms that, in order to find lasting solutions to today’s urgent humanitarian situations, the root causes of armed conflicts, such as underdevelopment, geostrategic ambitions, illegitimate access to the natural resources of other States, the unjust international order, inequality, marginalization and social exclusion, inter alia, must be addressed. Equatorial Guinea further reaffirms that, at all stages of the humanitarian-assistance process, the politicization of humanitarian assistance must be avoided.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"As the interpretation of humanitarian principles is difficult in practice, the need for critical discussion and ongoing debate is essential. In this regard, we believe that the strengthening of international humanitarian law should contribute to respect for the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law in terms of the sovereignty, territorial integrity of States, the self-determination of peoples and non-intervention in the internal affairs of States. Any humanitarian intervention must have the consent of the recipient country.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
Mr. Cohen (United States of America): We congratulate Germany on assuming the presidency of the Security Council for the month of April and thank France for its productive presidency during a very busy month of March. We also thank the briefers and welcome the Ministers who are joining us today.,No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"We thank the President and Minister Le Drian for convening this morning’s Arria session and this afternoon’s briefing on safeguarding humanitarian space. The topic is vital to improving our ability to save lives and ease the suffering of millions of people affected by conflict around the world today. The United States strongly believes that full implementation of international humanitarian law by all parties to a conflict is the best way to provide protection for civilians, including humanitarian personnel. We also believe that additional guidelines and policies should avoid inadvertently diluting principles of humanitarian assistance. Unfortunately, we know that the laws of war are not always universally observed, with grave consequences for civilians in need of protection and humanitarian assistance. Mr. Maurer and Mr. Lowcock know these consequences all too well.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"The United States pairs its role as the world’s largest single largest humanitarian donor with strong diplomatic efforts to promote respect for humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. We do this by speaking out against States that impede humanitarian organizations from meeting basic human needs. We have consistently called on the Syrian regime to implement the many Security Council resolutions calling for unimpeded humanitarian access across that country. Nonetheless, the Al-Assad regime continues to obstruct aid to those in need, including in areas under the regime’s control. We do this by condemning physical attacks directed against humanitarian personnel. South Sudan has for many years consistently ranked as the most dangerous place in the world for aid workers with blatant disregard for protections that should be afforded to them as civilians by all parties to the armed conflict. Attacks on health facilities and responders, including recent incidents in the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo are unacceptable. They must end. We do this by opposing resolution language that would require the “full consent” of affected States for the delivery of humanitarian assistance to people in need. States that use humanitarian access as a cudgel to deny starving women and children of food and water or prevent desperate people from having access to
life-saving medical care cannot be allowed to rely on a
resolution by the United Nations to justify their actions.
And we do this by correcting outrageous, dangerous
and baseless allegations against humanitarian workers
like those Russia consistently levels against the heroic
White Helmets in Syria.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Many of us are deeply engaged in protecting humanitarian space, but we can all do more. The United States supports efforts to widely disseminate accurate information about international humanitarian law among all parties to conflicts. A thorough understanding of international humanitarian law in principle and practice is fundamental to the training of United States military personnel at all levels. We further integrate international humanitarian law topics and principles into training that we provide to international military partners. For example, international humanitarian law principles are actively addressed in peacekeeping predeployment training that we provide to partner troop and police contributors deploying to United Nations and regional peace operations. The work that the United States has undertaken to ensure that civilians, civilian infrastructure and humanitarian locations and personnel are protected in some of the world’s most fraught conflicts is important, but it cannot replace the full adherence to international humanitarian law by all parties to conflict.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"We encourage Member States to engage more closely with non-governmental and faith-based humanitarian actors that can provide valuable insights about how to ensure the most vulnerable are protected and receive assistance. We welcome the joint initiative between Switzerland and the International Committee of the Red Cross aimed at strengthening the implementation of international humanitarian law, which included multiple rounds of dialogue designed to allow States to share best practices in a non-politicized, non-country-specific setting. We hope this type of exchange can continue.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session

"Mr. Adom (Côte d’Ivoire) (spoke in French): Mr. President, at the beginning of my statement, I would like to extend to you my best wishes for a
successful German presidency of the Security Council

challenges of international humanitarian law and the
strengthening of international peace and security. I
also extend my warm congratulations to France for
its outstanding leadership of the Council’s work over
the past month, and welcome the continuing presence
among us of Mr. Jean-Yves Le Drian, Minister for
Europe and Foreign Affairs, who has been with us, I
believe, for five days, demonstrating the importance
of our work here in the Security Council. Finally,
allow me to thank the distinguished briefers, whose
relevant briefings and recommendations further inform
the Council on the correlation between respect for
international humanitarian law and the strengthening
of international peace and security.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"The presence of new entities, in addition to State actors, in crises around the world has fundamentally changed the typology, motivations and thus the very meaning of the notion of “conflict” that prevailed at the time of the creation of the United Nations. These new actors, whose methods of combat pay very little attention to the norms of international law and the values of humanism that underpin our common action, operate outside the agreed codes of the law of war. In this way, the various forms of violence against civilians, schools, hospital infrastructure and humanitarian personnel are nowadays part of the sad range of warfare methods used by parties to some current conflicts. Furthermore, rather than waiting for these horrors to occur before repressing them, the collective conscience of humankind is called upon to promote the preventive dimension of international humanitarian law through the establishment of mechanisms aimed in particular at the prevention of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Côte d’Ivoire considers that the recurrent violations of the rules of international humanitarian law now constitute obstacles to the restoration and preservation of international peace and security. Indeed, respect for this legal corpus governing hostilities and reconciling the aims of war with the principle of humanity is today the instrument par excellence for protecting victims against abuses and atrocities committed during armed conflicts. That is why my country is of the opinion that scrupulous respect for the principle of distinction, the cornerstone of international humanitarian law, must be imposed on all belligerents. All parties to an armed conflict must, at all times and in all places, distinguish
between civilian populations and combatants on the
one hand, and between military objectives and civilian
objects on the other. In the light of the foregoing, Côte
d’Ivoire welcomes the decision of the Security Council
to make the prevention of armed conflict an integral
part of its primary responsibility in the maintenance of
international peace and security.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session

"In the context of the principle of the responsibility to protect, it is therefore incumbent on States, individually and collectively, to act in order to promote the rule of law and respect for international humanitarian law with a view to maintaining international peace and security.

"In conclusion, Côte d’Ivoire would like to recall that the Charter of the United Nations has provided for valuable instruments to strengthen the rule of law, particularly through the powers entrusted to the General Assembly, the Security Council and the International Court of Justice.

"Mr. Djani (Indonesia): At the outset, allow me to welcome, Sir, Germany’s presidency of the Security Council for this month, to which I look forward. I would like to express our sincere appreciation for the excellent presidency of France last month. Indonesia greatly appreciates your initiative, Mr. President, to convene this very important meeting, which conveys the importance of the humanitarian space in armed conflict. I would also like to thank Mr. Mark Lowcock and Mr. Peter Maurer, as well as Ms. Naz Modirzadeh, for their briefings, which provided us with a great deal of information.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"According to the report of the Secretary-General of May 2018 (S/2018/462), active hostilities and logistical challenges continue to impede the delivery of humanitarian aid. Armed conflicts have now become even more protracted and challenging, including interlinkage with counter-terrorism measures. I therefore note that preserving the humanitarian space to facilitate assistance to those in need demands our increased efforts. It requires our sensitivity and engagement with all parties involved in armed conflict. Against that backdrop, allow me to focus on three points.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"First, building trust is of crucial importance to ensure prompt and unhindered humanitarian assistance. Without trust all is for nothing. That recalls that the primary responsibility to protect the population throughout its whole territory lies with the national Government. We must therefore respect the sovereignty of the legitimate Government and, of course, gain the trust of the respective Governments and the people, including the affected communities where we are present.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"International humanitarian law also offers pragmatic direction that takes into account the sovereignty and security requirements of States. Ensuring the delivery of humanitarian assistance requires engaging with all parties to the conflict, both State and non-State actors. It is critical to manage dialogue and to seek a durable political solution. The message must be clear, namely, that our presence is not to judge but to assist. Humanitarian personnel are there to support the national authorities in showing greater respect for international humanitarian law.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"That brings me to my second point, on the importance of our collective efforts to safeguard the humanitarian space, for no single Government can resolve this alone. Together, we can act expeditiously, swiftly and effectively from the very outset to help the affected communities, providing basic needs, life-saving supplies and essential health care.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Together, we should also be flexible in our approach to engagement without sidelining humanitarian principles. It is not easy to deal with certain conflicting parties. Flexibility sometimes becomes part of the success in gaining confidence, thereby preserving the humanitarian space. Indonesia vigilantly upholds the principles of inclusivity and non-discrimination in its consultation with all segments of society, including the military, and in the provision of humanitarian assistance.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"My third point concerns the safety and security of humanitarian and medical personnel, since, working directly with communities every day, they often face life-threatening risks in carrying out their mission. Such a situation may also delay, or even disrupt, an effective delivery of humanitarian assistance. Safety and access for peacekeepers are a must and should be honoured by the conflicting parties. We must also ensure that United Nations peacekeepers are well equipped before their deployment to conflict areas. That includes training on international humanitarian law and respect for the core principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
Indonesia will host another regional conference on humanitarian assistance in 2020. That will also be a platform for sharing best practices to better protect humanitarian and medical personnel.,No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"On that note, the Security Council should explore ways to find more sustainable and context-appropriate actions in safeguarding the humanitarian space, in line with resolutions 2175 (2014) and 2286 (2016). There is no one-size-fits-all approach to delivering humanitarian assistance. But it must be delivered.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
Let me conclude by emphasizing that we have an obligation to save lives. We need to ensure that humanitarian assistance is provided to fulfil that noble intention.,No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Mr. Matjila (South Africa): I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on Germany’s assumption of the Security Council presidency for April. South Africa will support Germany as you lead the Council through the month.

It is for this reason that South Africa considers the attacks on humanitarian workers and medical practitioners in conflict situations to be serious violations of international humanitarian law and encourages States to push back to prevent these incidents from becoming the norm in conflict areas.,No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"To that end, South Africa resolved to embark on a project to champion the cause of “Health care in danger” by creating public awareness in collaboration with the ICRC office in Pretoria.

"The changing nature of armed conflict, from inter-State to intra-State, requires adherence to international humanitarian law by parties to non-international conflict so as to ensure the greater protection of the civilian population.

The United Nations could play at least three important roles with respect to the implementation of international humanitarian law.,No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"First, during peacetime, it is important for the United Nations to assist Member States, at their request, in cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross, with the dissemination of international humanitarian law instruments and their codification into domestic legislation, and, in cooperation with other United Nations organs and organizations, with the entrenchment and enhancing of respect for international
human rights law.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Secondly, the United Nations should continue to play a vital role in monitoring compliance with, and the prevention, stopping and punishment of violations of, international humanitarian law and applicable international human rights law during times of armed conflict. It is important to note that a proactive approach of dissemination and education should be the primary focus, not a reactive approach where action is taken only following grave breaches of international humanitarian law.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Thirdly, States must adopt, ratify and codify in their national laws the Geneva Conventions and the Protocols Additional thereto. Auditing, improving, reinvigorating and accelerating implementation is equally as crucial.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Given South Africa’s active role in peacekeeping and conflict-resolution processes, the Government has made efforts to train, and integrate practical measures for, the armed and security forces, in partnership with humanitarian organizations, to enhance knowledge of and compliance with international humanitarian law. We encourage other States to consider similar measures.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"In addition, South Africa, together with the ICRC, co-hosts annually a regional conference at which participants from the Southern African Development Community, the East African Community and the Economic Community of West African States are represented and where the implementation of international humanitarian law by various countries is discussed.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session

"In conclusion, South Africa firmly believes that the full implementation of and respect for international humanitarian law leads to reduced casualties and promotes the protection of the critical civilian infrastructure essential for emergency assistance during conflict as well as part of the long-term recovery of societies affected by conflict. We stand ready to partner with the relevant actors, in particular the ICRC, to commemorate this year’s anniversary so as to give prominence to the Geneva Conventions and the Protocols Additional thereto as they continue to guide
the actions of parties during armed conflict.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session

"But the reality is quite different. We all know that the norms of international humanitarian lower are being increasingly flouted, as was noted by other speakers this afternoon. The issue of safeguarding the humanitarian space, the topic of our meeting today, shows very clearly the main challenge that we are facing. Humanitarian actors all too frequently have to deal with major obstacles in the framework of their activities in conflict areas.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
So how can we strengthen the implementation of international humanitarian law? Belgium would like to share with the Council five good practices.,No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"First of all, we must promote the dissemination of information about the norms of international humanitarian law. National humanitarian law commissions play a key role in that regard by providing advice and assistance to the public authorities. The Belgian national commission was created in 1987, so it is one of the oldest ones around. It is prepared to share its experience with States wishing to establish similar bodies. I would like to also underscore the central role played by the national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies in the dissemination of information about international humanitarian law in their capacities as auxiliaries to the public authorities.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Secondly, it must be ensured that there is adequate training of the armed forces on this issue. We in Belgium make certain that international humanitarian law is part of the curriculum in the training of military personnel. We also invest in training troop-contributing countries on the protection of civilians, including in French.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Thirdly, States that provide support to parties to an armed conflict, be it in the framework of a coalition of States or through support for a non-State armed group, must ensure that they bring pressure to bear on the combatants so that the latter abide by the norms of
international humanitarian law.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Fourthly, we must prohibit measures within the framework of combating terrorism that impede the work of humanitarian organizations, whose activities are neutral, independent and impartial. It is therefore essential to take into account the potentially adverse effects on the humanitarian situation of the policies we adopt against terrorist groups operating in war zones, as well as sanctions measures that could have a negative impact on carrying out humanitarian work in specific contexts.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Fifthly, in line with their obligations under international humanitarian law, it is incumbent upon States to have the necessary means to ensure that the perpetrators of violations are accountable for their actions, thereby serving as a deterrent for committing atrocities. It is for that reason that combating impunity is important. In that regard, I would point out the contribution of the International Criminal Court in combating impunity for the most serious crimes, including war crimes.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"The Security Council also has a key role to play. It is in a position to encourage the training of peacekeepers in the field in the area of international humanitarian law, provide adequate space for international humanitarian law in the efforts to rebuild the rule of law in post-conflict situations, inscribe on sanctions lists perpetrators of the most serious crimes and make better use of existing monitoring and investigative mechanisms.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"In the face of the hundreds of daily casualties in armed conflict, it is the duty of us all to renew our commitment to respect international humanitarian law. That is why we welcome the initiative announced in that regard by Ministers Le Drian and Maas.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Mr. Allen (United Kingdom): As our briefers made clear, and as we all know, international humanitarian law consists of a comprehensive and universal framework to which all Member States are not only committed but bound. It is important, of course, that we enhance that framework whenever we see an opportunity to do so — and our briefers today mentioned resolution 2462 (2019), adopted just last week at the initiative of the French delegation, on the issue of terrorist financing, which includes important provisions on humanitarian action; as well as resolution 2417 (2018), on starving civilians as a weapon of war. But we do not lack law, we lack enforcement and accountability. Sadly, we are too regularly used to hearing terrible humanitarian stories
around this table. Time and time again, from Syria to
South Sudan to Yemen and the Democratic Republic
of the Congo — in fact, in every conflict situation on
the Council’s agenda — we witness the human cost
of the lack of respect for humanitarian principles and
international humanitarian law.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"The most appalling incidents become notorious and are brought not only to our attention by those agencies and operators on the ground, but also often brought to our peoples on their television screens — for example, attacks on aid workers or the bombing of hospitals. But we hear much less about the routine and insidious actions that nevertheless have a human cost in the end. I am talking about such things as the denial of visas for humanitarian staff, the removal of medical items from aid convoys, lengthy procurement and transport processes, the looting and diversion of pre-positioned goods by armed actors or the authorities, taxes and fines on goods and people, the closure of crossings, and the denial of registration to non-governmental organizations (NGOs). There is a long list.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"The human coast is clear. People starve, they suffer and they die when the humanitarian space is not respected. And we lose development gains that have taken years to achieve. To give one example from South Sudan, which we have talked a lot about in the Council, an international NGO with an in-country staff of fewer than 200 people estimates that it spends approximately $350,000 per year in South Sudan on administrative taxes and fees. Those financial costs are primarily paid to official or quasi-official entities. That is all money that should be going to protecting the people that those officials are in place to serve.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"As well as documenting attacks on humanitarian personnel or other egregious crimes, we need to gather data on the bureaucratic impediments and the actions that hamper humanitarian access. In that respect, let me commend the work that the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is doing to map out how access constraints relate to the severity of needs and the humanitarian assistance received. Let me also say that the United Kingdom is supporting research to ensure that the nature, frequency, scale and impact of attacks on health care in conflict is better understood to improve data collection analysis, as called for in resolution 2286 (2016). All of that data should be brought to the attention of the Security Council and its subsidiary bodies.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"For its part, the United Kingdom is always looking for any innovative ways to promote compliance with international humanitarian law. On 11 March, we published our first voluntary report on the implementation of international humanitarian law at the domestic level. Publishing specific examples of our practice to implement international humanitarian law is intended to help improve understanding of it and encourage informed dialogue on these issues, both at home and abroad. We hope it will encourage other States to publish details of their activities to implement international humanitarian law at the domestic level so as to identify best practices and improve implementation and compliance.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Of course, more can be done by State actors. Mark Lowcock talked about the importance of increasing the understanding and training of some countries’ armed forces. But he also spoke about the need to do so with non-State actors — a point made also by Peter Maurer. I think this is an area to which the Security Council could give greater focus. We could look both at education and training and ensuring that commanders are aware of their liabilities under international law, whether those are State or non-State actors, and look at tackling actions of non-State actors through sanctions in particular.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"I had not intended to talk today about Syria, which the Council regularly discusses. But the Russian representative today chose to continue his Government’s misinformation campaign against the White Helmets. The Russian Government does so to try to deflect attention away from the appalling war crimes committed by the Syrian regime — its attacks on its own people, including by its use of chemical weapons. Therefore, let us not have our attention deflected from the fact that Physicians for Human Rights corroborated 553 attacks on medical facilities in Syria in 2018, of which 498 were committed by the Syrian regime and its allies.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"It is very welcome, Mr. President, that you organized this briefing today. All here have reaffirmed their commitments. Good ideas have been shared by our briefers and by colleagues. However, I am struck by the contrast between our willingness to stake out a clear position in the abstract while at the same time not tackling humanitarian violations in country-specific conversations. In addition to today’s meeting, I think that we need to do the following.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"First, we must ask for, gather and then discuss data about not just the most egregious violations of international humanitarian law but also the bureaucratic impediments and interference with humanitarian assistance, which kill so many of those in most desperate need.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Secondly, we must ensure that the United Nations system is able to support States in spreading understanding of international humanitarian law and training armed forces, and Government officials more broadly.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Thirdly, we should consider how such understanding and training could be expanded to non-State actors and ensure they also are held to account.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Fourthly, we could call out consistently violations of international humanitarian law by all actors in our regular business and our country-specific conversations — whether on South Sudan, Syria, Myanmar or elsewhere.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Fifthly, we could put greater attention on humanitarian violations when designing and implementing sanctions regimes.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"And, sixthly, we should push consistently for an accountability mechanism where States cannot, or will not, act.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"As Mr. Maurer said, upholding international humanitarian law depends on our common acceptance that there are limits to war. We all, therefore, have a stake in upholding and strengthening it for our common humanity.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Mr. Singer Weisinger (Dominican Republic) (spoke in Spanish): Allow me, at the outset, to commend you, Mr. President, for having convened this meeting and to congratulate you on assuming your presidency for the month of April. You have the support of the Dominican Republic, just as we extended to France during the month of March, for the same values unite our three countries.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"It is more necessary today than ever to address the problems and challenges involved in the protection and defence of our humanity. I am referring to the sentiment that we are, in the end, one single humankind. In the Dominican Republic, our interpretation of that concept is very simple. The suffering of any woman who has fled violence more than once; the desolation felt by any family that is gradually dying of hunger and the lack of access to medicine; the girl who is forced into
marriage as the only way of surviving; the child who
has no access to education or the woman who has been

in the face of all this. No human suffering is alien to us.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"That was the case when, in the Second World War, the Dominican Republic was one of the few countries to welcome a group of Jewish families who found an oasis of protection and tolerance in our small country. We were no strangers to that principle when we were the first to offer assistance to our brother country Haiti after the devastating earthquake there in 2010. That is why we are here today in the Council to help restore optimism, hope and the desire to build a better future to the millions of people affected by armed conflict or other humanitarian emergencies.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"I sincerely thank today’s briefers and take this opportunity to express to them and to thousands of humanitarian workers and volunteers our gratitude and admiration for the work they carry out day after day, keeping alive those principles that mobilized and promoted the adoption and subsequent universal ratification of the Geneva Conventions.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Every day, we witness the tragic consequences of multiple and diverse forms of violations of international humanitarian law. In many cases, humanitarians are called on to respond to new and more complex types of violence and forms of warfare. However, far from calling into question the relevancy of the principles contained in the Conventions, we believe that these violations have further deepened the need to defend them and demand compliance with them by the parties to armed conflicts. It is precisely the failure to comply with these rules and principles that has led to a world that is steeped in suffering but has fallen short in its ability to enforce them.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"The region of Latin America and the Caribbean has not been unaffected by the consequences of conflicts and other, non-traditional forms of violence. Many of those did not exist at the time of the adoption of the Geneva Conventions and perhaps do not fall within the scope of application of international humanitarian law, but they do have humanitarian consequences and raise important challenges to the protection and alleviation of the suffering of the most vulnerable among us.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"The Dominican Republic, despite living in peace, is concerned with the strengthening of humanitarian action at the international, regional and national levels. It therefore strives to increase the capacities of all
humanitarian actors, including their military assets. In
that regard, between 2001 and 2019, 34,315 Dominican
military personnel have completed 637 courses and
training classes in international humanitarian law
and human rights in our highest military academy of
strategic studies. Of those courses, 50 per cent focus on
human rights, the use of force and women and armed
conflict, among others. Another 12,836 personnel
have been trained in issues related to international
humanitarian law and human rights.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"We also maintain significant cooperation with our brother countries of Central America in the framework of the Central American Armed Forces Conference (CFAC), comprised of the armies of El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic. Through that cooperation, 2,640 military personnel from those nations have been trained in our country in international humanitarian law. CFAC is a regional organization founded, inter alia, to promote the strengthening of peace processes, democracy and development in the countries of Central America, coordinate efforts to involve the population in emergency situations, and participate in humanitarian and peacekeeping operations in the framework of the United Nations.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"We believe that this is an excellent example of a response to one of the questions posed in the concept note prepared for this meeting, as it meets the need to disseminate understanding of international humanitarian law and humanitarian principles and to create spaces for exchanges and the training of humanitarian actors among the active military personnel of our countries. We hope to expand this programme even further and to create a platform for military and civilian training that will improve the understanding and implementation of international humanitarian law, including the humanitarian principles involved in achieving better and more effective coordination in Latin America and the Caribbean, particularly that aimed at meeting the needs of people affected by natural disasters in the region.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"In conclusion, it is our responsibility as States to place people at the centre of all of our actions, as we are all part of a single humankind. This includes those who serve in humanitarian situations. We must seek to establish mechanisms that will allow us to address the new challenges around humanitarian action in urban areas affected by new forms of violence. It is everyone’s responsibility to continue advocating vigorously and
tirelessly to ensure that the perpetrators of violations of
international humanitarian law pay the consequences of
their actions. Impunity is the reflection of indifference,
and indifference leads only to more violations, more
suffering and greater and worse consequences for the
peace and development of our peoples.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Mr. Duclos (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): At the outset, we commend last month’s French presidency for its efficient work in leading the Council. We wish the German presidency every success and welcome the presence of the German Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs, His Excellency Mr. Heiko Maas, as well as the other high authorities present today. We also thank the briefers for their informative presentations.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"In this year commemorating the seventieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, which enshrine the regulation of hostilities and ways to alleviate the devastating consequences of armed conflicts, Peru reaffirms its commitment to international humanitarian law and its proper implementation, as well as to international human rights law. We affirm this in a context in which these legal regimes are violated on a regular basis, which is why we stress the urgent need for the Council to fulfil its legal obligation and primary responsibility to act in unity and put an end to the suffering of millions of people in regions throughout the world. This should be complemented by effective action to promote sustainable peace — that is, activities to prevent, combat the root causes of conflict, strengthen institutions and promote the rule of law.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Peru is a signatory to the foundational international instruments of law of armed conflict, the provisions of which are duly developed and implemented in our domestic legal system, including the ongoing training of national authorities — in particular, our armed forces participating in peace operations — and the generation of measures to improve the protection of civilians. In that regard, we highlight the primary responsibility of every State to protect its population; when this does not occur, the international community has the duty to assume that responsibility, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Moreover, in accordance with resolution 2286 (2016), we reject all types of attacks against medical facilities and humanitarian workers, which constitute war crimes under customary international law. We express the same concerns about schools and condemn
attacks against them.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Similarly, as we recently said in the Council (see S/PV.8496), any State action in the area of counterterrorism must consider the effects it could have on humanitarian assistance efforts. As other delegations have said, we believe it is essential to ensure accountability for the commission of atrocity crimes. The universalization of international criminal jurisdiction and the predictability of access to justice will also help to more effectively prevent the suffering of civilians in conflict. In that regard, Peru reiterates the importance of cooperating with the International Criminal Court. We also advocate for the Council to make greater and better use of the institution by referring new situations to it. We reiterate our support for the work of the recently established evidence-gathering mechanisms.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
We would like to conclude by highlighting the sacrifice and risky protection efforts of humanitarian agencies and workers assisting civilians in conflict situations.

"Our discussion has made one thing clear: we are anything but indifferent to human suffering. Action must be taken wherever help is needed. Unfortunately, our discussion has also shown that doing that is becoming increasingly difficult. The humanitarian space is shrinking in many parts of the world. Armed conflicts are more complex today than ever before. They last longer and increasingly take place in urban spaces. A growing number of non-State actors and rebel groups are involved, and not only in Syria, where fragmentation is especially evident. Sadly, attacks on hospitals and medical personnel have become commonplace. Our meeting this morning made that clear too. Instead of being protected, the work of aid workers is becoming more dangerous. Yemen, north-east Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are just a few of the areas where that occurs. It is also vital that the Security Council address those tragedies. Talking is not enough. We have to take action. As today’s discussion has shown, three points are especially important.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"First of all, upholding international humanitarian law and humanitarian principles is vital. Such norms are not an end in themselves. They protect the lives of aid workers and the people they help. As the secondlargest bilateral donor, Germany rejects any kind
of political instrumentalization of humanitarian
assistance. Humanitarian space can be established only
if the neutrality, independence and impartiality of aid
workers are not in doubt. Humanitarian aid workers
live by those principles every day, often at great risk to
themselves. They deserve our thanks and full support
for the valuable work they do. Humanitarian space can
be established only where rules are in place. Only those
familiar with international humanitarian norms can
consciously apply them.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Secondly, therefore, we must help humanitarian actors impart the necessary know-how about international humanitarian law. That is all the more important at a time when an increasing number of non-State parties are involved in conflicts. Humanitarian organizations must therefore be able to continue working with such groups. If that is prohibited, the international community will lose influence over a group of players of increasing importance, which is not in our best interest. We also have a responsibility as States. What President Maurer said earlier today is important: we are all bound by international humanitarian law. Therefore, those of us who support parties to conflicts must especially ensure that those parties live up to their obligation to comply unconditionally with international humanitarian law.",Yes,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Thirdly, the law itself must not become the target of attacks — for instance, through national laws that supposedly take precedence over humanitarian law. We see that ever-more frequently, especially in the case of counter-terrorism laws. It is good that we at the United Nations are now discussing the impact of such laws as well as the consequences of sanctions on humanitarian work. Germany will play its part in that regard, including within the context of the various
sanctions regimes.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
Germany and France are determined to advance an exchange on this issue with all Council members. Our aim is to compile concrete recommendations in the coming months in a call to action intended to provide answers to pressing questions. Where and how should we ensure the protection of aid workers and those receiving assistance? Where do we need training and instruction in international humanitarian law? How can we better support compliance with international humanitarian law in conflict regions?,No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"Today’s discussion was a start. To mark the seventieth anniversary of the adoption of the Geneva Conventions in August, Poland, our partner in the Weimar Triangle, will follow up on today’s exchange. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Minister Jacek Czaputowicz for that. It is important that we all pull in the same direction. We have act where help is needed. That is the task of the Security Council. We should, and will, rise to the challenge. I now resume my functions as President of the Council.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
"I would like to thank all participants for their constructive contributions. Today’s briefing underlined the importance of a sharp focus on respect for international humanitarian law and on the responsibility of the Security Council in that regard. I am glad we had such eminent briefers with us today. I thank them for being here. Together with France, we will build on today’s debate and seek support from all Council members in this endeavour. The meeting rose at 5.30 p.m.",No,https://undocs.org/en/S/PV.8499,UN Security Council Transcript,8499th Session
